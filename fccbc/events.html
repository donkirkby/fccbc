<p>Come and join other FCC parents for a relaxing evening in the
beautiful setting of the Shadbolt Centre. Following conversation over
appetizers and dessert, Jane Liedtke, Founder/CEO of 
<a href="http://www.ocdf.org/">Our Chinese
Daughters Foundation</a> will share from her in-depth knowledge of 
traveling back to China (what are things to think
about in planning a trip? what would the experience be like for our
children?). Parents (e.g. Debbie Matheson, Peter Gibson and Marlee
Groening) who have returned to China will be available to answer your
questions and share their families' experiences.</p>
<p>This is a rare opportunity to meet Jane, who having lived extensively
in China is a fabulous resource. Check out her foundation website
(above) to get a sense of what she has accomplished and what she will
able to share with us.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't planning to return to China in the near future,
come and join us. Invite your travel group parents or other friends.
This is a rare opportunity for parents to connect with one
another 'sans kids'! Please feel free to forward this e-mail to
friends who have adopted that you feel might be interested.
We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Kathy Copeman-Stewart for arranging this coup!</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year Saturday 2 February, 2008</h3>
<ul>
<li>11 am - 3 pm</li>
<li>Floata Restaurant 180 Keefer St., Vancouver</li>
<li>Parking under restaurant</li>

<p>
As mentioned in the spring newsletter, the 2008 event will again be held at
the Floata Seafood Restaurant in Chinatown. Do register your family early (Registration form
coming soon). Patti Watson has agreed to stay on and organize our crafts
again this year, so we are very grateful to her for that and look forward to another
interesting array of things for the children to make.</p>
<p>Each year, we like to add new things to our event and we can't do that without an
extra person or two each year. Some of the team that have been involved for years have
decided to take a well earned break from organizing our event and we need some new
folks to step up and help organize. Please consider being a part of this great event by
contributing a few hours towards making it a great success yet again.
