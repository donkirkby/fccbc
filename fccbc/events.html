<h3>Camping on the Sunshine Coast</h3>
<p>Mark your calendars for the weekend of August 13-15, 2010. Camp for the 
weekend, or just come up Saturday for the potluck dinner. Details to follow.</p>


<h3>Friends of the Family Newsletter</h3>
<p>The FCC BC newsletter is mailed to members three times a year in the spring,
summer, and fall. It is dedicated to providing information about what is going 
on in our community. It discusses what it means to be a transracial adoptive 
family, and helps profile opportunities to bring Chinese culture into our 
families. We bring news on what is going on in the adoption community, adoption 
laws, and in China.

<p>We invite members and non-members to provide articles, information pieces, 
book reviews, movie reviews, referral and adoption announcements, photos of your 
children or anything you think might be of interest to FCC members. The deadline 
for submission to the newsletter is the 15th of February, June and September.</p>
