<h3>From Russia, With Love - Dec. 18th, 2006</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Airs Monday, December 18 at 9 p.m. on Knowledge Network</li>
</ul>
<p>Adoption is usually considered a blessing and an escape from a lonely
life. But what if it means leaving behind everyone and everything you ever
knew and travelling halfway around the world? From Russia, With Love,
airing Monday, December 18 at 9 p.m., follows the emotional journey of two
girls who must learn to adjust to a new life and family in Canada.</p>

<p>In a remote Russian village, Olga and Lera lived in an orphanage until two
Canadian couples came to adopt them. The adjustment was more difficult for
these older girls than it would have been for babies, and they both face
struggles that linger beneath the surface.</p>

<p>This heartwarming documentary follows the newly made families for three
years. However, what begins as an exploration of cross-cultural adoption
blooms into a story of human compassion, generosity, and the power of
love.</p>
