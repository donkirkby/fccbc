<h3>Christmas Ice Skate - Sunday, December 20</h3>
<ul>
<li>12:00 pm - 1:00 pm</li>
<li>Kerrisdale Cyclone Taylor Arena</li>
<li>5670 East Boulevard Vancouver, BC
(Corner of East Boulevard and 41st, behind McDonalds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy a rest from the bustling activity of Seasonal shopping!
We're pleased to invite all FCCBC members and families to a private skating party.
Skate the ice, catch up with friends, and maybe sneak in a carriage ride with 
Santa on the local high street.</p>

<p>Please remember to bring your skates, but if you don't have any, then rentals 
can be had for $3 a pair. The skate rental shop is open 15 minutes prior to and 
following the skate (11:45am to 1:15pm only). If you don't skate, come for the 
company, or feel free to use all the teaching aids that will be available - 
they're meant for the kids, but Eamon's been known to use the ice equivalent 
of an "easy-walker"!</p>

<p>Helmets are highly recommended - not just for kids. 
Noggins are not tougher than the ice - no matter how old you are. Bike helmets, 
snowboarding helmets etc work, but we also have access to some hockey helmets 
at the arena too if you don't own anything.</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year - Saturday, February 6th, 2010</h3>
<ul>
<li>Floata Seafood Restaurant 180 Keefer Street, Vancouver</li>
<li>11:00 am - 3:00 pm</li>
</ul>
<p>What fortunes await us in Chinese New Year 2010?
Chinese New Year or Spring Festival
 is the most important Chinese holiday of the year.
February 2010 will bring in the Year of the Tiger - 
one of the most dynamic signs of the zodiac.
Come celebrate this annual event with old friends and new, 
and enjoy a full roster of fun and entertainment. 
(Not to mention an eight-course meal!)</p>

<p>This is FCC's pinnacle event of the year! 
We hope to see you there. 
Print the <a href="PDF/cny.pdf">registration form</a> and mail it in by January 
15th.</p>

<h3>Friends of the Family Newsletter</h3>
<p>The FCC BC newsletter is mailed to members three times a year in the spring,
summer, and fall. It is dedicated to providing information about what is going 
on in our community. It discusses what it means to be a transracial adoptive 
family, and helps profile opportunities to bring Chinese culture into our 
families. We bring news on what is going on in the adoption community, adoption 
laws, and in China.

<p>We invite members and non-members to provide articles, information pieces, 
book reviews, movie reviews, referral and adoption announcements, photos of your 
children or anything you think might be of interest to FCC members. The deadline 
for submission to the newsletter is the 15th of February, June and September.</p>
