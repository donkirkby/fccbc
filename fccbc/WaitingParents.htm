FCC is committed to helping adopting families right
from the moment they submit their application. It can
be a very long wait from the time you complete all the
formalities with your agency and the time you finally
travel to China and pick up your long awaited child.
Our experience is that the waiting families group can be a tremendous boon in helping to bridge the gap.
