	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">If you've been praying for Kimberley ...
		THANK YOU, IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING!! We went to B.C. Children's Hospital on
		October 19th for another scan and the result shows that the tumour isn't as
		solid as it used to be. In another words, it has broken up, somewhat. It's
		fabulous news. Of course, our doctor says Kimmy isn't out of the woods yet, and
		we realize that, but hey ---- it's a step in the right direction. We'll take
		it! The news is better than we anticipated. </FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Leading up to the actual scan is always
		such an anxious time. You fear the worst and hope for the best. Before we got
		the scan result, we figured at best, things would be unchanged, since Kimmy's
		appetite and energy had remained good (Still is). But, to hear that it's not as
		solid as before, that's awesome. It's uncertain what has contributed to this
		latest development, whether it's the effect of the radiation, the herbal drink
		she takes, or all the praying being done on her behalf ... or everything
		combined. The doctors still aren't in a position to operate, but we're counting
		on it one of these days. Or, better yet, it just disappears altogether. We
		don't have to go to Vancouver until January for the next scan and in the
		meantime, we'll just monitor Kim and make sure her energy and appetite stay
		relatively good. So, for now, we're leading pretty normal lives. It's so nice.
		However, all it takes is one complaint of a sore tummy or not being hungry or
		of being tired and it brings it all back in a hurry. You start wondering the
		worst and hoping it's a cold or the flu. And, little ones', being observant as
		they are, sure learn quickly. KayLee (Kim's little sister) often tells us that
		her tummy hurts. Mostly, we put it down to 'attention seeking', but there's
		always that little voice in your head that keeps you second-guessing. That's a
		good thing, I suppose. </FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Kim is attending school (grade 1) full-time
		and she's back in dance. She's taking Jazz and Celtic and her Christmas dance
		recital is set for December 17th &amp; 18th . Don't you just know it's going to
		be a &quot;tear-jerker&quot;. It's so wonderful to see Kimberley bouncing around and
		playing with friends at school. She's come so far. But, as I keep saying, one
		way or the other, we're going to get her fixed!!! </FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Towards the end of summer, Kimmy was asked
		if she wanted to &quot;sleep with whales&quot;. Air B.C. periodically offers what it
		calls a &quot;fantasy flight&quot;. Children with life-threatening illnesses from around
		the province are given an opportunity to fly to Vancouver, along with a parent
		and a sibling (if the ages are appropriate), and they get a special 'after
		hours' tour of the Vancouver Aquarium. They learn about sea life, do some arts
		and crafts, have a midnight snack and then jump into their sleeping bags and
		sleep with the whales. Kind of different to wake up in the middle of the night
		and see a whale staring at you. The next day, it was free admission to the
		Pacific National Exhibition and a stay at the Atrium Inn that night, before
		returning home. The girls had a fun time. You know, on one hand, it's a little
		embarrassing that these free and special opportunities come our way once in a
		while, but on the other hand, it's tremendous that sick children have a chance
		to do something like that, because, lord knows, they deserve it!!! And after
		all, who wouldn't trade places in an instant, to be doing 'normal' things, but,
		as a healthy child. In view of the good news we've received, we're going to
		&quot;stay the course&quot;. We'll keep giving Kim that Chinese herbal drink, lots of
		love and laughter and plenty of praying, too. If you are one of those who have
		been praying for Kimberley..... THANK YOU and PLEASE....KEEP IT UP!!!
