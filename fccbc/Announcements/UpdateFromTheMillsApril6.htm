<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">KIMMY&#146;S WISH CAME TRUE!! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Our family recently returned from a one week
trip to Disney World in Florida, courtesy of Make-A-Wish Foundation and Give
Kids the World. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It was WONDERFUL!! Everyone was so friendly and
accommodating. It was such a safe place and we had a tremendous amount of fun.
Kim was in her glory! The only difference amongst all the pictures we took, was
the background. Otherwise, they all consisted of a common foreground&#133;a
huge smile on Kimmy&#146;s face. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It was sad to have to leave, knowing this
fairytale existence would have to come to an end and we would once again, have
to face reality. Two days after returning from our trip, Kimberley was back at
B.C. Children&#146;s Hospital for another round of Chemotherapy. At the end of
this month, the doctors will do a scan to see if this latest Chemo treatment
has shrunk the tumour. If not&#133;it&#146;s back to the drawing board, but
we&#146;ll be pushing to be included in the imminent clinical trials of that
new Cancer Treatment that hit the news recently, referred to as
&#147;Metronomic Dosing&#148;. Apparently, scientists in the lab have had
tremendous success eradicating tumours in mice by using small, but constant
doses of Chemo in combination with drugs that prevent the growth of blood
cells, which tumours need in order to grow. Human trials are next and if
conventional methods aren&#146;t working on Kimmy, we want on board. </FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Recently, a B.C. organization called the Coast
Foundation Society awarded Kimberley with a certificate, honoring her courage.
Admittedly, it stemmed from a letter I submitted as part of the
organization&#146;s Courage To Come Back contest, but I felt it was so
deserving. Kim is such a brave girl. So inspiring! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">And, now that we&#146;ve returned to reality,
we&#146;re looking to have our #1 Wish Come True!! </FONT></P>
