<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">Dim Sum Sunday</h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">I had about 8 families respond affirmatively to the idea of arranging dimsum<br>
a few Sundays in the year.<br>
<br>
Can you please mark your calendar for Sunday April 28th for 11 am. Details
of exactly where to go, will be posted next week after I have come back from
Victoria where we are headed for Spring break. As mentioned previously, I
intend  booking a dimsum place in China Town near the CCC. What I hope to
arrange is a back room where the kids and parents can mingle more freely.
Then anyone who wants to come will telephone the Restaurant IN ADVANCE to
let them know they are coming. This way the restaurant will have an idea how
many are coming.<br>
