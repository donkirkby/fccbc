	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">There is mixed news in the wake of
		Kimberley's latest assault on her tumour. She underwent 17 days of radiation
		therapy in May and June. The results of the subsequent scan taken on July 17th,
		show the tumour has shrunk a little bit. That's the good news. However, the bad
		news is, it didn't shrink enough to warrant surgically removing it. The trouble
		of course, is that the tumour is situated around a major artery, making any
		surgical attempt very risky. Obviously, it's not the ultimate news we were
		hoping for, but at least it's still positive. The doctors say, as far as
		conventional treatments go, that's all they can do. They plan to do another
		scan in October. </FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">My wife and I suspected the tumour had
		shrunk, because Kim's appetite increased noticeably a couple of weeks after
		radiation treatment ended. We also noticed fewer complaints about her stomach
		hurting. Kim looks great!! People who haven't seen her for a while, can't
		believe it. The medical team had to take Kim's feeding tube out, in order to
		carry out the scan and when the dietician saw how well Kimmy was doing (she is
		now in the proper range for her weight), she suggested keeping it out on a
		trial basis, especially since Kimmy was on her way to Camp Goodtimes the
		following week. We had prepared Kim for a few weeks leading up to the camp trip
		and during that time, she waffled on her views of whether she was going or not
		... at nighttime she would usually say she didn't want to go. We told her we
		would just go to the rendezvous site and if after meeting some of the other
		campers and counselors, she still didn't want to go, that's okay. We explained
		that we would not force her to go. Well, she had an hour pretty much one-on-one
		with her camp counselor before they were scheduled to leave and they hit it off
		well. She was quite content and that made it easier for us, because, while we
		had prepared Kim for the camp, we neglected to prepare ourselves and we were
		saying to each other the night before and driving to the rendezvous site that
		morning, that we secretly didn't want our girl to go. KayLee sure didn't want
		her big sister to go. She cried when Kim got on the bus. Well, we're glad and
		Kimmy's glad that she went. She returned a week later with fond memories and
		samples of camp songs that I'm sure will get us kicked out of public places one
		of these days. Here's a sample: </FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Second verse, same as the first .... a
		little bit louder, a little bit worse&quot;. And on it goes. Fun!! While we carry on
		with our search for Kimmy's cure, we take comfort in the fact she is feeling
		great and we plan to follow through with regular activities in the fall, like
		school (grade 1) and returning to her dance classes. Perhaps these activities
		will assist with her emotional well-being, which we firmly believe, affects a
		person's physical well-being. Our doctor says it's difficult to know whether
		any cancer cells are still alive and even in the event there are, they could
		lay dormant for some time. So, we hold onto that possibility with the thought
		that it buys time to find some miraculous cure or for some miraculous cure
		still to be discovered in time. In the meantime, we continue with the herbal
		drink (Naturin 2) and we have intensified our search into alternative
		treatments. Of course, there are many and we need to be cautious because many
		of these alternatives are simply money-grabbers. But, we believe in our hearts
		that eventually, we will stumble across something that will cure our Kimberley.
		For now, it's good enough that the tumour doesn't grow. </FONT></P>
