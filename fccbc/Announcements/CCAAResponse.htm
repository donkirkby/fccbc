<h2 align="center">Response from the CCAA</h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CCAA has posted a reply to the many comments received in response to the announcement of quotas. The full text is re-posted below. The document makes three points.<br>
<br>
   1. The quota on overall numbers of adoptions is temporary until they can clear the massive backlog of dossiers already stacked up at CCAA.<br>
   2. Adoptions of children with medical special needs will still be fast tracked and do NOT count against an agencies overall quota.<br>
   3. The 5% limit for dossiers from single parents is not changed.<br>
<br>
Here's the complete text, minus special characters:</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Open Letter of Matters Concerning Receipt of Application Documents for Adoption<br>
</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To the adoption agencies and organizations concerned:<br>
<br>
Many adoption agencies and organizations have written letters and sent faxes to the China Center of Adoption Affairs (CCAA) since the Center sent out the Notice of Receiving Application Documents for Adoption in the Year 2002, expressing their understanding of and support to the measures taken by the CCAA to overcome the problem of the piles of documents in stock and shorten the period of time for examining and approving adoption applications and also putting forward many excellent suggestions at the same time as to how to further regulate the adoption work and the qualifications of the adoption organizations. For this, the CCAA would like to express the sincerest thanks to the adoption agencies and organizations for their positive coordination and friendly cooperation. Now we would like to elaborate the following three explanatory points on matters you are concerned about:<br>
<br>
   1. The question concerning the receipt of the amount of application documents for adoption. As is expounded in the Notice, the measure for putting the receipt of the amount of application documents for adoption under control in the year 2002 is a temporary one for the purpose of solving the problem of the pileup of documents in stock at the present stage, as it has caused the waiting time for the adoption to prolong much longer than ever before, and it is a readjustment of the method of work, and not a change of adoptive policy. In so doing, it has purely taken into account the interests of the adopters and the adoption organizations. The adoption agencies and organizations concerned are kindly requested to actively cooperate with us and submit the application documents for adoption according to the checked and ratified amount.<br>
<br>
   2. The question of adopting children of special needs. The CCAA has all along attached great importance to the work of adoption of children of special needs. In recent years, many of them have found their homes through the method of authorizing the adoption organizations to seek adoptive families. In 2002, the China Center of Adoption Affairs will continue to authorize adoption organizations to seek adoptive families for the children of special needs. To make sure this work can be smoothly carried out, the CCAA has adopted the following two measures:<br>
      One, the number of adoption of the children of special needs by adoptive families through the adoption organizations authorized by the CCAA will not be restricted by the 2002 amount.<br>
      Two, Green Passage will continue to be through for expediting the adoption process for their benefits, so that they can go home as early as possible for medical treatment.<br>
<br>
      Specific practice:<br>
      (1) The adoption agencies and organizations willing to take up the task of seeking adoptive families to adopt children of special needs may put forward their written applications to the CCAA, and the CCAA will send the materials concerning the children of special needs to the adoption agencies and organizations concerned after it has examined and approved their applications. After the adoption agencies and organizations concerned have identified the adoptive families, they should send to the CCAA the conditions of the adoptive families together with their plans for medical treatment of the children of special needs. With the verification and consent of the CCAA, they will go through the formalities according to the adoption procedures;<br>
      (2) To seek adoptive families for the children of special needs is a task even more complicated than the ordinary adoption. The peculiarities on the part of the children of special needs call for more superior conditions of the adoptive families than that of the other adoptive families. For example, the adopters should be imbued with the kind of love for the children of special needs; the fine psychological preparedness and quality for raising them; the skill and mental preparedness for taking care of them; they should have stable occupation and relatively high financial income as well as the environment and conditions beneficial to the rehabilitation of the children of special needs. Apart from all this, the adoption agencies and organizations should give more loving care and more consideration for these adoptive families in rendering services to them.<br>
<br>
   3. The question of single adopters. When checking and ratifying the amount of application documents for adoption in the year 2002, the CCAA has fixed the number of application documents for adoption by single adopters at not more than 5% of the total amount. In so doing, it has proceeded completely from the consideration of the immediate interests of the adopted children as required by our working principle of Everything for the Children. Therefore, we have to choose the family environment best suited to the healthy growth of the adoptees.<br>
