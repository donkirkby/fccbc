<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">A little over 5 years ago (Nov.02/94), my wife
and I were blessed when a 10 month old girl was placed in our arms. Here we
were, standing worlds away, in an orphanage in the city of Zhanjiang, Guangdong
province, People&#146;s Republic of China, and a young, innocent life was
placed in our trust and care. Moments before getting the pleasure of holding
this little treasure, another of the many couples in our adoption group, had
bent down to pick up this same infant girl, thinking it was their adoptive
child. But the group facilitator (Bonnie Wong) was quick to point out the
error. I often wonder, if the mistake had gone unnoticed, what would life be
like today&#133;for her, for us, for them. And I think about that a lot these
days, because this little treasure that we call Kimberley WeiXiang Marie Mills,
has recently (Nov.23rd) been diagnosed with cancer. Officially, it&#146;s
pancreatal blastoma&#133;cancer of the pancreas. We are told it is a rare
tumor, as far as children go, and in a rare location (behind the pancreas, as
opposed to in front of it). As a result, the doctors say they aren&#146;t in a
position to give an accurate prognosis. Certainly, the hope is to shrink the
tumour with chemotherapy treatment, then surgically remove it and follow up
with more chemo. So, it&#146;s one day at a time. Obviously, my wife and I are
praying for our girl&#146;s recovery so that she can continue to live out the
dreams she has, and perhaps, even some of the ones we have envisioned. Again, I
often think of that mistake at the orphanage, and then I smile and beam with
pride, because in those 5 years, our girl has given us so much joy (as I hope
and think we have given her). Bias perhaps, but we believe Kimberley to be
extremely intelligent, with a soft demeanor, a good nature, a big heart, and a
knockout smile that lights up a room. Truly, we have been blessed and we are
better people for knowing this girl, this angel. And, in spite of the threat
facing this young life, this sweet girl, if I had the opportunity at the
orphanage to do it over&#133;.I WOULDN&#146;T CHANGE A THING!!! </FONT></P>
