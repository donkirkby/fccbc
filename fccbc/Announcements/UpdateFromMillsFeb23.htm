<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">UPDATE FROM THE MILLS FAMILY - February 23, 2000</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Our faith in humanity has been
restored!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Over the past several weeks, our family has
been blessed with support from kind-hearted souls. In many cases, the support
has been from people we don't even know. Case in point: a benefit concert was
held in Kim's honour on February 17th. It was organized, almost
single-handedly, by a Kelowna musician whom we had never met. The only
connection we have, is his daughter and Kimberley are in the same Kindergarten
class.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The concert was a huge success and it's all
because of this angel, disguised as a man. Actually, we are surrounded by
angels, from family and friends and friends of theirs, to complete strangers.
And, we would like to say from the bottom of our hearts - thank you for
thinking of and caring for Kimberley.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The Provincial Tumour Board has reviewed Kim's
case and has concluded that two chemotherapy sessions are not enough to gauge
whether or not this is the route to go. The board figures it is still
worthwhile pursuing chemo treatment, but have selected new drugs that won't be
as hard on her hearing, as the previous chemo. The plan is to give three rounds
of this new treatment, do a cat-scan to see if the tumour has shrunk, then
perhaps follow up with a couple more treatment sessions. If the tumour shrinks,
the next step is to remove it. If it doesn't shrink, radiation will be
considered. Kim has undergone the first session (Feb.10-13) and is doing so
much better than the other times. Her energy is pretty darn good and she's not
experiencing the nausea or pain that was previously evident. In fact, we think
she's doing better now, than before the diagnosis. We believe there are a few
reasons, including the fact she has gained some weight back, thanks to the
feeding tube, and also, due to the Chinese herbal supplement (Naturin 2) she's
been taking. It's designed to boost the immune system. We think it must be
working.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Kimberley even ventured off to school for a few
days prior to going to B.C. Children's Hospital for the latest round of
chemotherapy. She didn't miss a beat and her classmates were so good to her. It
was sweet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Kim undergoes her next round of chemo on March
02 and shortly after her return, will actually have something to look forward
to---the trip to Disney World, organized and paid for by the Make-A-Wish
Foundation. The timing should be such, that she ought to be feeling strong when
we go.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It's wonderful to watch children adapt and
incorporate challenges into their playtime. Kimmy and her sister, KayLee, often
play &quot;doctor&quot; these days, and recently, Kim, playing the role of the
doctor, told KayLee, the patient, that she would be right back---&quot;I just
have to consult with another doctor&quot;, she said. Oh, how they learn!</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Again, thank you for caring about
Kimberley!!!</FONT></P>
