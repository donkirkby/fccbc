<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">HOORAY&#133;&#133;.We have Kimmy back!!!
However, it is with mixed emotions. Quite unexpectedly, Kimberley and Mom
(Elaine) were sent home from Children&#146;s Hospital (in Vancouver) on January
26<SUP>th</SUP>. She was scheduled to begin a 3<SUP>rd</SUP> round of
Chemotherapy treatment that day, but the Doctors advised us that the Chemo has
not been successful in shrinking the tumour. They don&#146;t want to continue
with the Chemo for that reason, and also because the side effects have taken
their toll on Kimmy, in particular, a very significant loss of hearing. At this
point, the loss of hearing only impacts on her in a crowded environment where
&#147;background&#148; noise is evident and perhaps with some &#147;soft&#148;
sounds such as TH or S. (We haven&#146;t noticed any difference yet). A
Provincial Tumour Board, consisting of 2 dozen Oncologists/Pediatricians will
review Kim&#146;s case and offer alternatives. These options will then be
presented to us (hopefully in a few days), plus, it will give us an opportunity
to present queries and/or suggestions. So, it&#146;s quite possible Kimberley
may have to travel to some distant research hospital. But---WHATEVER IT
TAKES!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">In the meantime, we are ecstatic at being a
family again. Kimberley is in great spirits, she&#146;s feeling good and
actually gaining some weight, thanks to the feeding tube and the fact she is
eating a bit during the day. Her beautiful smile is back, so is her sense of
humour and she is laughing a lot these days. We all are. Little sister, KayLee,
is benefiting from our reunion, as one might expect. The behaviours that had
surfaced during Mommy and Kimmy&#146;s absence have now disappeared. We&#146;ve
re-introduced Kim to her classmates and her Teacher made a special visit at
home and next up is a visit from a classmate, then off to school the two of
them will go, with Mom or Dad in tow. We&#146;re also planning a trip to
Kim&#146;s dance class, so she can sit in on it and if she&#146;s up to it,
participate. So, we&#146;re venturing out, albeit with cautious steps.
It&#146;s just so nice to have her home. Prior to her surprise return home, I
had done some figuring and discovered that in the one month period beginning
right after Christmas, Kim had spent only one day at home (between stays at
Children&#146;s Hospital and Kelowna General), but fortunately, that one day at
home was her birthday (Jan. 9). We still have to schedule her birthday party,
because her immune system was too low for her to have the party on her
birthday. The other big plan in the works is the trip to Disney World. Thanks
to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, our family is scheduled to travel to Disney
World in late March. Kimberley is soooooo excited.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Although the news isn&#146;t what we would
prefer, we are keeping our chins up in an effort to make life as normal and
pleasant as possible, for our big girl. We&#146;re still hopeful and confident
that a miracle is out there and we intend to find it!!!! </FONT></P>
