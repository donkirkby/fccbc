<p>Family membership in FCC BC is $20 per calendar year.</p>

<p>Members receive:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Information on upcoming events via newsletter and email</li>
	<li>FCC newsletter, Friends of the Family is mailed three times per
	year</li>
	<li>Periodic other publications, such as the international FCC
	newsletter</li>
	<li>A directory of members</li>
	<li>Discount at FCC events</li>
	<li>Opportunity to join an online discussion group as well as
	participate in influencing the priorities and directions of the
	organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Print the <a href="PDF/membership.pdf">registration form (PDF)</a>.</p>

<p>Information provided by families is held in strict confidence, for
the use of elected FCC representatives for FCC purposes only. Only with
the express consent of the family concerned will their information be
published in a members' directory. And if a family wants to share some
but not all information they supply on the form, this can be indicated
on the application form.</p>

<p>What specific information a family chooses to enter on the form is
the family's choice. At an absolute minimum, it is possible for a family
to join FCC BC by supplying only two pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
	<li>an indication that they have a child adopted in China</li>
	<li>a mailing address for the newsletter and other mailings</li>
</ol>

<p>(Even names can be withheld, given that a number is assigned to each
member family in the database.)</p>

<p>The benefits of sharing more information are many. If families
indicate multiple ways of being contacted (e.g. e-mail and phone), they
are more likely to receive timely information about an event. And, if
enough families supply enough information about variables such as age of
child, neighbourhood, month and year of adoption, orphanage, family
size/composition, etc. it becomes possible to connect families with one
other.</p>
