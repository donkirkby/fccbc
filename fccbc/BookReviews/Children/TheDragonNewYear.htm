<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This book takes the format of a wise
grandmother passing on to her beloved granddaughter, a Chinese legend about the
beginning of the tradition of celebrating Chinese New Year. The story weaves a
tale about an evil sea dragon, the Buddha, and a grieving mother who has lost
her son to the sea dragon. The qualities of courage and kindness enable the
woman to overcome the dragon and make way for a better and safer year to come.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The illustrations are exquisite and the story
an exciting one. It is not suitable for young children, however, as the sea
dragon is indeed monstrous. This would be a suitable New Years gift for an
older child. Ages 7 and up years </FONT></P>
