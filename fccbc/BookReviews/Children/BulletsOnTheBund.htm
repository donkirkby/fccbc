	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Have you seen any kids' fiction with a main
		character that is an adoptee from China? I hadn't, up until I read Steve's
		book, and I'm pleased I did. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Autumn is 12 years old. With her best
		friend Adam, she stumbles on a mystery; a small dog wearing a back pack,
		running through a park after school. Autumn and Adam decide to do some
		detective work, in the best tradition of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, and the
		fun begins. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> Autumn is also a daydreamer and a writer.
		She imagines a story of a young Shanghainese girl, abandoned at birth as she
		was, who is caught up in the happenings of war as the Japanese are starting to
		invade. The tale of Qiu Yu is woven between Autumn's detective work, with nice
		effect. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The story is engaging, the characters well
		drawn. A good deal of information about Chinese culture and history, and a
		nicely done portrayal of some of the issues and life a Chinese girl adopted
		into a western family will face, are laid on with a reasonably light hand.
		</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I haven't seen anything else like it. More
		books are planned. </FONT></P>

		you're in Vancouver, phone Steve direct at (604) 987-9852. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Part of the proceeds benefit the Half the
		Sky Foundation, which supports orphanages in China. </FONT></P>
