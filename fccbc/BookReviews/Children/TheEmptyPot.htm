<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This book was featured on the children's
television program, &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; and thus the story may be
familiar to some of you. The book is written and illustrated by Demi, with
exquisite drawings and a clear, simple text. The story is about a boy named
Ping who lived a long time ago in China. He loved flowers and had a talent for
growing them. Along with many other children in the kingdom, he enters into a
contest sponsored by the Emperor, to discover who can grow the most beautiful
flower. The story is a fable which emphasizes the courageous spirit that is
required to be an honest person. Both my daughter and I enjoyed the beautiful
illustrations and the moral of the story. Because we read and re-read this
story throughout the Spring and Summer, when we too were planting flowers and
waiting for the outcome of the blossoms, we could emphathize with Ping's
hopeful watching and watering of his plant. Suggested age group: 2 - 6 years of
age.</FONT></P>
