<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This would be a good choice for a Chinese New
Year's gift for a child. It is not about Chinese New Year, but is a book
devoted to poetry with dragon themes. It was a New York Times Notable Book of
the Year. The poetry is Jack Prelutsky at his best, with titles such as
&quot;I'm an Amiable Dragon&quot;; &quot;I Wish I had a Dragon&quot;; &quot;The
Dragons are Singing Tonight&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;I am Boom!
The Thunder Dragon&quot;. The artwork is superb. The rhymes are a good
introduction to poetry, and soon you will find that your child knows most of
the poems by heart. This is particularly true when they begin running around
the house shouting &quot;I am Boom! The Thunder Dragon, taller than the tallest
trees&#133;&quot; Ages 3-10 </FONT></P>
