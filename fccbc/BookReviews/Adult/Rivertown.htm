<font FACE="Arial">
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2"><b>By Peter Hessler</b></font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2"><b>2001, Harper Collins, New York</b></font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2"><b>Reviewed by Heather McDonald</b></font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">When you read a wonderful book, you feel like telling everyone
about it. This is the case with this recently published autiobiographical
account of a young Peace Corps volunteer assigned to teach English and American
literature to students at a teachers’ college in China. This book was
recommended by the New York Times Book Review, and I endorse the recommendation.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">The author taught at a college in the small city of Fuling, in
the heart of China’s Sichuan province. He taught there in 1996 and 1997, which
made his story an important one for me to read, since he writes about the lives
of rural and urban Chinese people during the time my daughter was born. I want
to purchase this book to give to my daughter to read when she is older, as it
will help her to understand what life was like in China during the year of her
birth.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">Hessler has an observant eye, and his stories of his students,
their families, the faculty, and the people in the city amount to a gripping
account of modern China. I couldn’t put the book down once I began to read it.
Hessler became fluent in Mandarin after his two years of study and practice in
the language. He was able to forge important relationships with Chinese people
because of his facility with the language (and sometimes because of his lack of
it!)</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">The following is an excerpt of the author’s encounter with a
few farming families during a hike he made one day outside the city. It provides
an interesting insight into China’s one-child birth policy:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">They studied me for a while and I waited for somebody to ask
    about my salary. But one of the women turned to me and asked instead,
    &quot;In your country, do you have planned-birth policy?</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;No. You can have as many children as you want.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">They shook their heads, amazed. I told them that in America
    there wasn’t a population problem, and so the rules were different from
    those in China.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;How many children are in your family?&quot; one of the
    women asked.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;Four. Three sisters and me.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;Here you can’t do that,&quot; she said. &quot;Only
    one – if you have another, you have to pay a fine.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;More than ten thousand yuan!&quot; another woman
    interjected.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">Some children had come over to look at me, and I noticed two
    small boys standing together.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;What about them?&quot; I asked. &quot;They look like
    brothers.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;That’s right,&quot; the old woman said. &quot;Their
    parents had to pay a fine.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">One of the boys was about four years old; his brother was
    six or seven. They were filthy, and they stood tentatively on a wheat
    terrace above us, afraid of the waiguoren [foreigner]. A little girl of
    about five came over – a tiny thing with wild black hair and dirt-smudged
    cheeks. Wide-eyed, the child stared at me. She had enormous coal-black eyes,
    like my youngest sister, Birgitta, when she was little. I smiled, and the
    girl smiled back.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;She’s the third in her family!&quot; one of the
    women said.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said. &quot;They must have paid a big
    fine.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;No,&quot; the woman said. &quot;Their house was tuile!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;Their house was tuile!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;Tuile?&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;Right!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">I couldn’t believe it, so I quickly sketched the character
    on my notebook. &quot;This tui?&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">&quot;That’s right.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">It meant any number of things: to push, turn, cut, infer,
    shift, postpone, elect. But when you tui’ed a house it meant simply that
    you knocked it over. The local planned-birth officials had pushed over the
    girl’s house because she had been the third child.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">I had read of such things in the foreign press, but I had
    always assumed that they only happened in very remote areas. But then I
    realized that I had been walking all day, and this small beautiful valley
    was nothing if not remote.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">The old women were shaking their hands and looking at the
    little girl. She wasn’t comfortable hearing this conversation and
    something in her expression said: Sorry. Undoubtedly there were
    complications in growing up when you knew that your birth had caused your
    family’s home to be knocked over. But there was also something else in her
    eyes; it was vague and undefined and meant, essentially: Some things are
    worth more than money and houses. The old women saw it, too. One of them
    tousled the girl’s hair, and then she ran off to play with the other
    children in the unplowed fields.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">Hessler places this poignant anecdote in full context. Other
parts of the book explain that a ten thousand yuan fine is approximately two
years’ salary for the average urban worker in China. And the fine must be paid
in cash, all at once. And with respect to the family of the little girl he met,
he explains that it was a relatively prosperous rural area, so that this
particular family had the financial resources to withstand losing their house.
Many families are not in a position to pay such high fines, nor to recover from
the loss of the only home they have.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">I like Peter Hessler’s insight into people and their motives,
including his self-analysis. His book is a profound and elegant read.</font></p>
