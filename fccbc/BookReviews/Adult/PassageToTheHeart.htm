<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Book Review - A Passage to the Heart</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Edited by: Amy Klatzkin, San Francisco
FCC.</B> Published in 1999 by <A HREF="http://www.yeongandyeong.com">Yeong and
Yeong Book Company</A>, St, Paul, Minnesota.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> &copy; Reviewed by: Jim Weaver,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This book is a compilation of
articles published in various newsletters of FCC groups in North America and
the UK. It is a collection of such quality and breadth that each article leaves
its local origins behind like the shuttle leaving its launch pad. The assembly
of these articles neatly defines the process of synergy; the combination
greatly exceeds the sum of the parts. </FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The book is organized along the
time course of the adoption process. The early articles deal with the waiting
period and other aspects of the pre-adoption process, it then moves into travel
and getting settled into family life. The focus then expands into an
outstanding section on health and development issues, adopting an older child,
and single parenting. This is followed by outside perspectives on our
experience, sections on culture, racial issues, going back to China and
finishes with an excellent section on adoption and birth parents and how some
families have handled this issue.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">As the proud dad to a young
lady from China, this book has many articles in the early sections that sounded
very similar to our experiences. The later sections provide valuable trail
markers for those portions of the journey that we have yet to travel. In my
alter ego as the current custodian of the FCC web site this book is
frustrating. On one hand, I would like to simply post the entire opus on the
web site, but on the other hand, I think that every China adoptive family
should buy the book. I will have to find some balance of posting enough of the
articles to provide information not otherwise found on the site but still
leaving people with a strong incentive to spend their cash on this excellent
book.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I would especially recommend
this book to any family considering adopting a child from China. The writers
are the ones who have been down that trail and point out both the incredible
rewards that these children bring into our lives and some of the very real
problems that can beset the process. The value of these voices of experience to
the prospective adoptive family can hardly be overstated. Any adoption agency
with a China program should have copies to lend out to families, however they
may have a hard time getting them back.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">In conclusion, I highly
recommend this book to families in any and all stages of the China adoption
process. As an additional benefit, a portion of the profits from this book will
go to two charitable organizations that directly work to improve the lives of
children in the orphanages in China. </FONT></P>
