<p>From the moment you commit to adopting from China you will be on a
voyage of discovery. As much as the internet is a huge source of
information, it's still hard to beat meeting face to face with families
who have already walked the path of adoption and also to network with
others in your area at the same stage as you in the process.</p>

<p>We are committed to providing Waiting Families with a forum to meet
and network with others. We provide a pleasant, informal and friendly
atmosphere for you to meet, and will do our best to provide answers to
your questions and to help you meet others at the same stage of the
process as you.</p>

<p>If you would like to attend a waiting families event or if you'd like
more information on the program please contact <script
