<p>Come and join other FCC parents for a relaxing evening in the
beautiful setting of the Shadbolt Centre. Following conversation over
appetizers and dessert, Jane Liedtke, Founder/CEO of 
<a href="http://www.ocdf.org/">Our Chinese
Daughters Foundation</a> will share from her in-depth knowledge of 
traveling back to China (what are things to think
about in planning a trip? what would the experience be like for our
children?). Parents (e.g. Debbie Matheson, Peter Gibson and Marlee
Groening) who have returned to China will be available to answer your
questions and share their families' experiences.</p>
<p>This is a rare opportunity to meet Jane, who having lived extensively
in China is a fabulous resource. Check out her foundation website
(above) to get a sense of what she has accomplished and what she will
able to share with us.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't planning to return to China in the near future,
come and join us. Invite your travel group parents or other friends.
This is a rare opportunity for parents to connect with one
another 'sans kids'! Please feel free to forward this e-mail to
friends who have adopted that you feel might be interested.
We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Kathy Copeman-Stewart for arranging this coup!</p>
