<p>Chinese New Year 2007 will bring with it lots of changes - but never fear - 
the best parts remain! On Feb 10, 2007, we will be having our annual Chinese 
New Year party at the fabulous Floata restaurant in Chinatown. The party will 
be held from 11am to 3pm with some great crafts to start off the day for the 
children. This new year will see us having a sit-down lunch with some 
interesting new items on the menu!</p>
<p>The restaurant is a beautiful big venue in the heart of Chinatown with great acoustics
and we will have some wonderful entertainment for you to enjoy. We are also happy to
have parking provided this year. Simply bring your parking ticket with you to the
restaurant. The registration form is on the back page. Please note the address for mailing
as well as some changes to the registration. If you are inviting extended family or friends
to the event, please remember they are eligible for the non-member price.</p>
