<h2 align="center">FCC from a Waiting Parent’s Perspective</h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Frank Kenny, Co-chair, FCC BC &amp; NWWA</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A little over a year ago, my wife and I started to take the first steps
towards adopting a child from China – steps that most of you will have long
ago taken, and the tension of which you have perhaps even forgotten a little.
Despite what has now already seemed like an eternity, we are still looking at
another 6 months or more of waiting and the ‘final event’ still seems
somewhat unreal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortunately, one evening not too long after our initial ‘vetting’, we met
a very resourceful and resolute woman at a Sunrise meeting, by the name of
Morgan Armstrong. Morgan was also feeling a bit intimidated by the looming long
wait and soon decided to form a resource group for parents waiting for children
from China. For the five couples and one single who have met regularly since
then, this has been a godsend. The waiting process has seemed much more bearable
and through ‘special guest’ appearances we have also learned a great deal
more about the process, what to expect, what causes delays and so on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of those guest appearances was from your immediate past co-chairman who
promptly enlisted my participation as your next co-chair – to serve,
fortunately, along with the long-experienced FCC co-founder, David Robinson.
While accepting such a post seemed to fit well with my current ‘retiree’
status – that is, I thought some time to donate -- I certainly felt unsure of
taking such a position, given that we had yet to accomplish our first adoption,
compared to most of you who have had one or more children for some years.
Nevertheless, as hands seemed to be needed, here I am. I hope that I can do
credit to the efforts so many of you have made in the past.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we first learned about FCC, it certainly seemed like an organization we
would want to be involved in – <i>later on</i>. At that time, it seemed like
maybe a couple of years later on. Now that I’m involved with FCC, it seems
that services for waiting parents could have been and ought to be a logical
extension of FCC itself – readily available to as many new prospective parents
as possible. After all, who better to guide and counsel new applicants than
those who have come before? I would hope that offering such services would also
be a good source of new and committed members. So far I have had good positive
responses from those of you with whom I have mentioned the idea so far. Any
further feedback would be most appreciated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In any event, I’d certainly like to make the creation of a waiting-parents
service a personal priority for at least my first few months as co-chair.
Hopefully during this time I’ll also get to meet as many of you as possible
and begin learning about those things you would all like to see continue, as
well as those things you would like to see evolve. So also please forward any
suggestions for new services to me whenever you can (ftkenny@shaw.ca). One
thought that has come up, for example, is a possible annual clothing/ equipment
exchange type of thing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Otherwise, I am looking forward to meeting many of you at the New Years
celebration – assuming, of course, that David’s little Maia doesn’t
somehow ‘negotiate’ me out of my ticket.</font></p>
