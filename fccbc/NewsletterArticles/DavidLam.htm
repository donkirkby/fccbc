British Columbia </H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">&copy; 1998 by
<A HREF="mailto:JohnGBowen@email.msn.com">John Bowen</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">(based on an interview reported in Chinese
Canadians: Voices from a Community Vancouver, Douglas &amp; McIntyre
1992)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">In 1988, the Honourable David See-Chai Lam was
appointed British Columbia&#146;s twenty-fifth Lieutenant-Governor. David Lam
is the first Canadian of Chinese origin to have become a Lieutenant-Governor of
any province.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Dr. Lam left an established career in banking
in Hong Kong and came to Vancouver in 1967 with his wife and three young
daughters to begin a new career, embarking on a life that would lead to
unimaginable financial success and social distinction. Discipline, openness of
mind and a incisive understanding of human nature are perhaps the key
ingredients to his success. David Lam brought to the position of position a
deep attachment to his Chinese heritage, a subtle blend of Christian and
Confucian philosophies and the firm support of his cherished wife
Dorothy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">David Lam was born in Hong Kong in 1923. His
parents came from a Shantou, in China, which is about 180 miles from Hong Kong.
Although horticulture was his greatest interest, it was banking that became his
career. In 1952 David married his childhood friend Dorothy. They were blessed
with three daughters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">On arriving in Vancouver, David Lam was offered
a job in a bank, but the job would have taken him back to Hong Kong. So he
embarked on a new career, real estate. This career, suited him well, for within
a comparatively short period David Lam had accumulated a sizeable fortune.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It is thanks to David Lam, in no small measure,
that <I>the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden</I> was built in
Vancouver&#146;s Chinatown. The project was incredibly difficult to organize in
the early 1980&#146;s when China was still relatively closed to the outside
world.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">When asked about multiculturalism, David Lam
offered the following views; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><I>&#147;To me, multiculturalism doesn&#146;t
mean one can just stay in one&#146;s own ethnic group. Multiculturalism to me
is love&#151;love for your country&#151;and the desire to contribute the best
of your culture to make Canada better. What is the point of hundreds of
different minorities living together in isolation, ignoring each
other!</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><I>Multiculturalism is not totally understood.
People think that it is my shield, my wall, my protection. Leave me alone to
speak my own language, follow my own culture and do my own thing. If it is so,
then I would ask in what way are you contributing to your country? When I speak
to various groups a lot of my message is that the best way the country will
improve is for everyone to contribute his or her best. Participate, I say.
Coming to Canada is like being invited to a pot-luck dinner; if everyone brings
leftovers, we&#146;ll have a leftover dinner. But if one spends some of
one&#146;s time, picks one&#146;s best recipe, and is prepared to give
one&#146;s best, we will have a feast.&#148;.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">David Lam has retired from his position as
Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, but continues to serve the citizens of
his province in a variety of ways. He expressed a long-standing ambition to be
a missionary. An a certain sense, he has already fulfilled that
ambition.</FONT></P>
