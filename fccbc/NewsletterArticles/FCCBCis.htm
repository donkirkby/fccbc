<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">We families with children adopted in China have
had an organization of sorts for several years. And since about a year ago, we
actually had a semi-formal structure and a name. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">But it took an invitation to a meeting to all
BC and NW Washington parents of children adopted in China and a vote by those
who accepted to create a legitimate body to represent their collective
interests. On October 25, 1997 at the West Vancouver Recreation Centre about 30
parents voted to create FCC BC . Two co-chairs were elected, David
Robinson and John Bowen for a term of one year, commencing January 1,
1998.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">In this issue of Friends of the Family you will
find a record of the discussion and decisions taken at the meeting and an
application form for membership in FCC BC . We hope you and your
family will join. Please send your completed form and cheque to our treasurer,

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">As far as possible, the operative principles
for FCC BC  will be direct democracy and organizational simplicity.
All important decisions will be voted on by all members, either at a meeting,
held at least once a year, or by proxy (e-mail, fax, phone or mail).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">At some future date we may wish to write a
constitution and mission statement for FCC BC . For now, we will
suppose that the function of FCC BC  is to identify and advance the
common interests of families with children adopted in China. Some of these
interests might be:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> maintaining contacts for our children with
similar adoption and country of origin experience for possible later support
and friendship; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> parents exchanging experiences of child
raising and adoption issues; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> cultural exposure and advancement for
children and parents; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> assisting others who want to adopt in China;
</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> maintain links with FCC&#146;s around North
America and around the world; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> advocacy/ protection of our common interests
(lobby function); </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> assisting children left in orphanages - eg.
establishing charities; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> fun and recreation; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> organize trips to China after 2000. </FONT> 
</LI>
</UL>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Even without any formal organization there is a
lot of spontaneous, healthy interaction between local families with children
adopted in China. The events FCC BC  stages will complement
these.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Already, we have been approached by other
FCC&#146;s to participate in proposed charity initiatives for orphans in China.
In addition, I have spoken to Bonnie Wong about possibly taking needed supplies
into orphanages from FCC BC  when she takes groups there to bring
home children. I hope to have some options to present to members in the next
issue of <I>Friends of the Family</I>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">On November 5 I wrote to the Vancouver Chinese
Cultural Centre (CCC) Board to ask of a meeting to &#147;explore ways of
co-operating to mutual advantage&#148;. On December 5, David Robinson and I met
with the Chairman and Executive Director of the CCC (see lead story). Also,
Susan Waugh and Bonnie Wong invited representatives of the PRC Consulate to
attend our Chinese New Year Celebration. Bonnie Wong kindly offered to sponsor
their presence. Investing in these sorts of relationships, we hope, will bring
dividends for our children in years to come.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">George Wilhelm is arranging for FCC BC &amp; NW
WA to have a web-site of our own. It will be connected to the main FCC web-site
managed by FCC New York. Look for it after Christmas on the main FCC web-site
at http://www.fwcc.org/.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">FCC is something that should exist only at the
pleasure of its members. It should prove its worth every day. I think there are
many ways that we families of children adopted in China can together contribute
to better outcomes for our children. Please think about ways that you can
invest a little effort on all our behalf so you may realize a worthwhile
return.</FONT></P>
