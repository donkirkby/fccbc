<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">One could not have asked for a better turn out,
especially on short notice. About 30 or so families attended a buffet dinner at
Grand Buffet (6401 Kingsway, Burnaby) on Wednesday evening November 17, 1999 to
meet five representatives of the Central Chinese Adoption Agency (CCAA) and 2
Social Welfare Institutes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The delegation, lead by Mr. Zhang, Zhong,
Deputy Director of CCAA, met with families at the end of a visit to the US and
Canada prior to heading back to China. Other members of the delegation included
Ms. Zhao, L. and Mr. Xing, K. of the CCAA, Ms. Wang, C. of the Beijing Social
Welfare Institute and Mr. Chang, Q. of Yueyang Social Welfare Institute.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The evening was informal and we occupied half
of the restaurant. David Robinson formally welcomed the delegates on behalf of
the families, which was followed by a Chinese song sung by some of the
children. Mr. Zhang extended his greetings to the group after which there were
opportunities for the children to have pictures taken with the delegates.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Many thanks to Bonnie Wong for arranging the
dinner and coordinating the evening. She did an excellent job getting the word
out regarding the dinner. Now if we could somehow get as good a turn out for
the AGM.... </FONT></P>
