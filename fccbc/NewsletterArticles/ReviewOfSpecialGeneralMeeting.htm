<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">On Saturday, May 8, FCC of BC  held
a Special General Meeting to discuss the proposed Constitution and elect a new
co-chair. Eleven members, representing eight families, attended. While the
attendance was not what we had hoped for, the interest and rousing debate more
than made up for it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Overall, the response to the constitution as
presented was positive.Most of the comments, related to language and word
usage. For example, a number of people drew attention to the need for a more
inclusive language in the constitution, i.e., not all families are two parent,
nor two gender.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">A few of the points stimulated vigorous debates
yet remain unresolved. One issue that arose involved the lack of fairness that
arises from one vote for a single parent family, versus two votes for a
two-parent family. Membership was another issue that surfaced, i.e., should
membership include families with children from China and related organizations,
or families only. An additional point that emerged was the minimum number of
newsletter issues per year that FCC members&#146; can/should expect. This last
point also highlighted a debate that has come to light since the meeting,
regarding the need for an constitution in the first place.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The last point also relates to the unresolved
areas of the constitution and involves the matter of how to access membership
voices, in a democratic, efficient and cost-effective manner. This access is a
critical process in order for organizational leaders to act on behalf and in
accordance to the wishes of the membership with some degree of confidence.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">As the constitution process now stands, the
revised constitution will be perused by a new set of eyes in order to take the
constitution to the next level, and then hopefully back to the membership for
your approval. So, stay tuned.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Many thanks again, to John Bowen for all the
time and effort he put into the first constitution draft.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Not to be upstaged by a constitution, was the
election, by acclamation, of our new co-chair, Wanda Pierson. Congratulations
Wanda, and a hearty welcome. In addition to co-chairing, Wanda will be chairing
the planning committee for our upcoming Chinese New Years Party.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">On a final note, a problem that surfaced at our
SGM was the matter of childcare during our meetings. While we want to encourage
the attendance of children, the resulting noise level rendered some of us
almost incoherent. I think the time has come to either hire a couple of
babysitters or have several parents volunteer to baby-sit the attending
children at each meeting. Any feedback or volunteers?</FONT></P>
