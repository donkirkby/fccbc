Delving into the past can be risky business, especially for someone who's
adopted.  When Mary Klaasen went looking for her birthmother, she discovered
that trying to locate her would take perseverance and guts, and that
succeeding in the search was not the end, but another beginning.  This video
diary recounts Mary's personal journey to find the woman who gave her life.
It's a fascinating story of a reunion fraught with suspense, humour and
vitality.  This poignant film is directed by Beverly Shaffer, and produced
by
Shaffer and Mark Zannis.
