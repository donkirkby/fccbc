<h1>Help For the Game The Power of Two</h1>

<h2>Rules</h2></a>

<p>
Each turn has up to three phases: movement, placing pieces (depending on the
first phase this may or not occur), and aging pieces (pieces are only aged if
pieces were placed this turn).  In all cases only your own pieces are placed
and only your own pieces are aged (and possibly removed).
<p>
a) A player moves one of his pieces any distance along a line (if none of your
pieces has a legal move, you lose). For example, one possible first move for
Light is m13-j7.
<p>
If the destination intersection of a newly moved piece contains no occupied neighbors then the turn is complete and no pieces are added or aged (as described below).
<p>
b) If the destination intersection of a piece you just moved is next to an
existing piece (yours or your opponent's) you must place a new piece in such a
way that it forms a triangle with your piece and the neighbor.  For example, if
Light moves initially from m13-m5, he must place a piece at l4.  This move
would be written m13-m5:l4.
<p>
There may be more than one possible way to form a triangle.  For example, in
Figure 3 below, if Dark moves from a1-e1, he may place a piece at a1 (the
intersection he just vacated) or at g1.

<p>
If you move to an intersection adjacent to two or more pieces, you must place a
piece for each occupied neighbor (even if one intersection would have formed a
triangle with more than one of them).  For example, Dark may move from a13-c11
and place pieces at d10 and a13 (written a13-c11:d10,a13).
<p>
If there is not room to add the required number of pieces, the move is illegal.
For example in Figure 3, Light cannot move from m13-k11 since there would be no
way to form a triangle with the piece at j10.
<p>
c) If your move causes pieces to be added, then the piece you moved and any
pieces of yours which you moved adjacent to are aged.  A newly placed (fresh)
piece is represented by a capital letter. A fresh piece is aged to a lower case
(aged) piece.  If an aged piece undergoes aging a second time, it is returned
to your supply of unplaced pieces.
<p>
In Figure 5 (a1-d3:b4,e5), the moved piece now at d3 would be aged to "x" and
the piece at c5 would be removed from the board.  The newly placed pieces are
entered as fresh pieces "X" and the opponent's piece at e3 is unaffected even
though it played a part in determining placements.
<p>
Aging occurs strictly after placement, so a piece cannot be placed on an
intersection which will be vacated by aging.  This also means that aging is not
taken into account when determining if a move is legal (i.e., if all possible
placements can be made).
<p>

The game ends if your turn ends (i.e., including aging) with all sixteen of
your pieces on the board.  
<p>
Normally you may run out of pieces to place in step
b).  In other words, it must be legal to move to the destination intersection
but it is okay to have too few remaining markers to actually place.  However if
you play with the "exact" option you must use your markers up by exact count.
<p>
<h2>Strategy</h2>

Whenever possible it is most efficient to leverage ones opponent's pieces in
placing new pieces.  If you consider a piece to have two lives, then on the
simplest case, moving one of your pieces next to another you lose two lives due
to aging and gain two due to placement for no net gain.  However, if you place
more than one on a turn or use the opponent's pieces you gain ground.  Also, be
careful that you do not allow yourself to be surrounded.
<p>
