		<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"> ABOUT THE APPLICATION FORM FOR FAMILY MEMBERSHIP</H3>
		</CENTER> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> The form is necessarily long to provide
		for the fact that FCC is an organization of families. Families vary greatly.
		Some have one parent, some have two. Some have one adopted child from China,
		some more than one. Some families have children born to one parent or both and
		some have children adopted from countries other than China. All members of all
		member families are important to the life of the family and the life of the
		organization.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> The motive for requesting a lot of
		information is to compile a database of information that families may, at their
		discretion, want to share with other member families. It is understood that
		different families will have different views about how much or how little
		information they want to share and with whom. It should be clear to everyone
		that what information they choose to share is entirely their decision and
		disclosure is not a condition of membership in FCC BC  and NW
		WA.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> An FCC member's control over FCC use of
		family information can be exercised in two ways:</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> All information supplied on application
		forms is entered into a database. This information is held in strict
		confidence, for the use of elected FCC representatives for FCC purposes only:
		Only with the express consent of the family concerned will their information be
		published in a members' directory. And if a family wants to share some but not
		all information they supply on the form, they can indicate same on the
		application form;</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> What specific information a family chooses
		to enter on the form is the family's choice. At an absolute minimum, it is
		possible for a family to join FCC BC by supplying only
		two pieces of information:</FONT></P> 
	 <OL> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> An indication that they indeed have a
		  child adopted in China and </FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> A mailing address for the newsletter
		  and other mailings. </FONT></LI> 
	 </OL> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> Even all names can be withheld. A number
		is assigned to each member family in the database, anyway.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"> The benefits of sharing more information
		are many. If people supply more ways of being contacted (eg. e-mail and fax),
		they are more likely to be contacted, and less likely to miss something when
		time is scarce. And if enough families supply enough information about the sort
		of variables that typically interest members, it will be possible to readily
		connect families with each other. The sorts of variables I mean are - age of
		child, neighbourhood, month and year of adoption, orphanage, family
		size/composition, etc.</FONT></P> <HR>
