<h2 align="center">Our Two New Co-Chairs</h2>
</b><i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Frank Kenny</font></i><font face="Arial"> is
a newcomer on the block. He and his wife, Monique, have forwarded their adoption
papers to China and are waiting to complete the adoption process.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Frank is a retired neuropsychologist from
Toronto who is presently enjoying his newfound freedom. His many past times
include writing the music and lyrics for pop songs and playing these on his
keyboard. Unfortunately his talents do not include a good singing voice, so he
is on the look out for budding singing talent! He is recording his songs in New
Brunswick.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Frank brings a new dynamic to FCC as a
waiting adoptive parent. He is part of a waiting parents group and will be
encouraging their participation in FCC events as well as seeking active
involvement by FCC members in helping waiting parents go through the adoption
process.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">David Robinson</font></i><font face="Arial">
is an old timer who has been a past co-chair of FCC as well as a Director of the
Adoptive Families Association of BC. He is a litigation lawyer, with emphasis on
personal injury, in his own small firm in Richmond. He is still involved in the
notarization of adoption papers of adopting parents going to China.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">David and his wife Jackie, have two adorable
girls adopted from China, Cleone (4) and Maia (6) and Jackie is a contented stay
at home mom.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Maia fell victim to Frank’s lovely humour
when she first met him. Uncle Frank suggested that she give him three smarties
and Maia being somewhat generous gave him three small packets of smarties in
return for $20! Uncle Frank drew a cheque for $20 on the bank of Maia,
purportedly signed by David Robinson as president of the bank! Maia was not
fooled a bit and has given her dad strict instructions to recover full damages
from Uncle Frank.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Unfortunately due to David’s other
commitments, he can only give limited time to FCC and has indicated that despite
the two-year tenure as co-chair, he may resign after one year. He hopes by that
time FCC will be heading in a new direction and there will be members clamouring
to take over as co-chair.</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial">Plans for FCC</font></p>
</b>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">It is too early for the co-chairs to say what
their plans are, but following the AGM, when positive support and ideas were
given, they can give some indication of where they intend taking FCC with the
support of its members. There will be a drive for new membership at both ends of
the spectrum, waiting parents as well as parents with older children. To achieve
this, the co-chairs will be promoting better communication both with and between
members, and new programs/events of interest to both young and old children.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">John Bowen</font></i><font face="Arial">,
another former co-chair, has offered to liaise with the Chinese Cultural Centre,
and help design the Chinese Cultural Camp for 2002. Wanda Pierson helped shape
this camp last year for our children and it was well received by those who
attended. The intention is to have this camp in July/August (or if sufficient
interest is shown, at other times as well) at the Chinese Cultural Centre with
emphasis for children probably in the 4 to 9 year age group. There will be more
published about the proposed camps in the New Year. FCC seeks your support by
having your children attend this camp.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The newsletter is going to be revitalized by <i>Kathy
Stewart</i>. It is vitally important that FCC be kept informed on what is
happening with its members and their children. FCC wants to know, for example,
how waiting adopting parents can be helped, what problems are encountered in the
adoption process, what Chinese schools children are attending, what adoption
issues are coming up, particularly with older children, how these are being
handled, how FCC can help in any way and all the myriad matters that new
adopting parents will want to know from those who have older children. Your
support is very much needed.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Rick Waugh</font></i><font face="Arial"> is
continuing to run the FCC website. He is putting a discussion line on the
website. Hopefully this will be invaluable for waiting parents seeking
information and contacting members who have recently returned from China. The
discussion line can be used to inform others of schools, daycares, Chinese
teachers, and Chinese cultural events in localities where members live. Please
try out the discussion line as soon as possible.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Wanda Pierson</font></i><font face="Arial">,
the previous co-chair for FCC, has kindly agreed to run the Chinese New Year
event on <b>February 2, 2002</b> for the third (and understandably the last)
time. <i>Danielle Soulodre</i> will be assisting Wanda. This event is quite an
undertaking and help is required to make it a complete success. Wanda does have
a number of volunteers already, but more are needed. Please give a little time
to volunteer for this event. We depend on members to make this event the success
it is. <b>Remember that early registration is required for this event</b>, so
please book now if you have not already done so.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Also needed are one or more individuals to
take over the running of the Chinese New Year event for 2003 and those
interested are requested to contact either Frank or David. They invite feedback
on whether this event should be held yearly in its current form at the CCC,
which requires a lot of planning and manpower. Alternatives, of a less demanding
nature, may include having the event held at a hotel or suitable restaurant.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Chinese New Year parade in Chinatown will
be held on <b>February 17, 2002</b> which is the Sunday following Chinese New
Year.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Lorna Hunter</font></i><font face="Arial"> is
the liaison person in charge of the Volunteer Chinese Grandparents Project. For
those who do not know about this, this is an undertaking promoted with the
assistance of the Chinese Cultural Centre in which families are matched with a
Chinese senior. The senior shares experiences with you and your children.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Cathy McDormand</font></i><font face="Arial">
continues as FCC’s treasurer. <i>Peter Gibson</i> continues to be in charge of
membership and FCC’s Directory.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Heather McDonald</font></i><font face="Arial">
will be co-ordinating the summer picnic, which has been booked for <b>July 7,
2002</b> at Ryall Park Picnic Shelter, New Westminster. Please mark your
calendars for this event. Last year was a wonderful hot summer day and the water
park, playground and clown was a great hit with the children. Entertainment will
also be arranged for this picnic.</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Camille Gueymard</font></i><font face="Arial">
is looking into booking the North Vancouver Outdoor School facilities in
Paradise Valley near Squamish for a weekend either in spring or summer. The
facilities have huts and chalets for 20 to 80 people. The idea is to have an
event where parents and children can spend time together, and socialize. It is
hoped such an event would appeal to those with older children. Activities may
include horseback riding and other outdoor pursuits. David Robinson also has in
mind organizing a soccer game between older children and parents!</font></p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Steve Whan</font></i><font face="Arial"> is
researching the feasibility of setting up a website for North America linked to
the FCC website, which would be for FCC members wishing to offer other members,
home exchanges, rentals to and hosting of other FCC members. Such a site would
make it possible for members and their children to stay with or meet up with
other FCC members when they travel. This was brought home to David Robinson when
he met a lady from the US at last year’s FCC picnic who had traveled to
Vancouver for the CCC cultural camp and had rented an expensive and far from
satisfactory apartment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">FCC last year arranged for one of its members
to host an information session at their home for adopting parents about to go to
China. It was an opportunity for people to get to know each other and ask
questions in an informal setting. Speakers included Dr Elizabeth Watts who spoke
about medical issues, Connie Munro (then co-chair) who spoke about her recent
trip to adopt from China and David Robinson, who spoke about FCC. FCC will
continue arranging one or two information sessions a year. Anyone interested in
hosting a session are asked to contact David Robinson or Frank Kenny.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The co-chairs welcome all ideas to strengthen
and foster ties between members and their children. Please write to the
co-chairs and, if possible, be prepared to volunteer your services! FCC can only
function successfully if its members volunteer their help.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Lastly FCC’s bank balance stands at a
healthy sum of $7,788.</font></p>
