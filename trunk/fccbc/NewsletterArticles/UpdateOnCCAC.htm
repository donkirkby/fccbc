<h2 align="center">Update on CCAC</h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Bonnie Wong, FCC BC </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CCAA (China Centre of Adoption Affairs) has recently announced a quota system
for some countries including the United States, only allowing a certain number
of adoption applications each year from each adoption agency and applications
from single applicants allowed no more than 5% of the total quota. The quota
became effective on December 1, 2001. Meanwhile, CCAA has decided not to impose
a quota on English-speaking provinces in Canada at the present time. However for
the year 2002, CCAA hopes that the provinces would not send more adoption
applications to CCAA than what were sent in the year 2001, and applications from
single applicants would be allowed no more than 5% of the total applications.
For BC applicants, this change should not affect married applicants, and it
should not affect single applicants whose dossiers were registered by CCAA
before December 1, 2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Timing over at CCAA (from the time the applicants' dossier is registered by
CCAA until the time CCAA is ready to match a child to the applicants) is
unfortunately getting longer and longer. Currently the timing is about 13
months. Hopefully the quota system would be able to help stopping the timing
getting longer.</font></p>
