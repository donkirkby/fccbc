Revisited - Another Adult Korean Adoptee Tells Her Story</span></h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Editor's
Note - John Bowen, the first editor of &quot;Friends of the Family&quot;, wrote
an article entitled, &quot;Sunny's Disposition&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The article described the unhappiness of an adult Korean Adoptee named
Sunny from Norway, who was and is studying at SFU.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The article was reprinted in a number of other FCC newsletters in Canada
and the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
following is a reaction to &quot;Sunny's Dispostion&quot; by another Korean
adoptee living in Texas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wrote
to John in January 2002.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Dear
John,<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">Following
is a synopsis of my life as a Korean adoptee living in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I read your article entitled, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;Sunny's
Disposition&quot;</i> on the FWCC site, and thought you might find my story
interesting, and perhaps, encouraging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
think that if I had adopted a little one from Asia, as you have, I'd be curious
as to how other adoptees have handled their adoption experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, I believe I may be one of the older Korean adoptees in
the US.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So here goes:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">I
look at my story as proof that anything can happen in one’s life and that
things have a way of working out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was born in Korea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The exact time
and place can only be guessed at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
story is that I was left in a basket on the doorstep of an orphanage located in
Taegue.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">I
was adopted by my parents, Donald and Rosalia, in 1963 when I was 11 months old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Life is definitely made up of moments; some more important than others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One important moment in my life happened when at about 10 months of age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I raised my head, looked at some passers-by, and flopped my head back
down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How long could that have
taken - two seconds, maybe three?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
turns out the passers-by were an easy audience, and Don and Rosa felt that my
performance rated a permanent home and a lifetime of love and care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Three seconds well-spent.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">At
the time of adoption, I was undernourished and underdeveloped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At 11 months old I was 21 inches long and weighed in at 10 pounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The doctor warned my parents that I would likely be mentally retarded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My parents took me anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
mother doctored me back to health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
far as being mentally retarded, I think that I’ll paraphrase someone and
simply say that the news of my mental retardation was premature.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">My
older sister, Angela, was also adopted from Korea.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We spent our childhood in Iowa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We were THE minorities in North Scott County.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I remember that at one point an African-American family moved
into our school district.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Angie and
I were the only Asians in attendance, and Chuck and his siblings were the only
African-Americans.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">In
some ways being a true minority was a great way to live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I vaguely remember being doted upon by older kids who thought that I was
cute, adorable, something quite apart from anything they’d seen before. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Now
tell me, if there were 20 other little Asian girls around, would I have gotten
all that attention?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think not.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">On
the other hand, the ignorance level of some of the farm kids was quite high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In first grade two little boys called me a “nigger.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I went home and asked my mother what that word meant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think it must have broken her heart to hear her child called a racist
name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My mom very wisely told me
that those boys were stupid, and if they were to call me any names, be them
“jap, “chink,” “nigger” or any other such things that they were wrong
– I was Korean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time in
that place, most kids had no idea what or where Korea was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So, I mostly grew up thinking that there were a number of dumb kids out
there, and when called names, I’d say “I am not, I’m Korean,” (no one
ever said “hey Korean!!”) this said with a totally,
pardon-but-your-ignorance-is-showing attitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And, as far as I was concerned, that settled THAT.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">So
far I have mentioned my mother mostly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is not to in any way indicate that my father was absent from my childhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My father was and is a very quiet man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But he adored, just ADORED my sister and me, and was very much a part of
our daily lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I feel that
my strong self-esteem comes from my security in his unfailing, unconditional
acceptance and pride in me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Okay.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just wanted to mention that, because it is an important
part of how I grew up and who I am today.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">When
I was 13 my family moved to Austin, TX.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Life
there was okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Austin is
definitely an oasis in Texas and a great quality of life can be had there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One thing of note, I never again ran into any kind of racist incidences
in school once I moved to Texas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
south seems to have received the rather unwarranted title as being the bastion
of racism in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think
ignorance can be found anywhere – it’s quite unbiased that way.<o:p>

my adult years.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1985 I graduated from Texas A&amp;M with a BBA in Business
Analysis – management information systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I also earned a MS in Psychology in 1995.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I married my husband Randy (whom I met when we were both
juniors in high school) in 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
stoically and successfully managed to never use my degrees.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At this time I am a certifiable bon-bon eating, stay-at-home,
net-surfing, TV-watching, book-reading, sometime-gardener, seldom-as-possible
housekeeper, and great adorer of the loves of my life, my two sons (ages 11
&amp; 14), and husband.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">I
haven’t any issues with being adopted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was always raised with great love, and I believe, sensitivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Somehow, I don’t know if it is completely my parents’ accomplishment,
my disposition, or the combination, I managed to ALWAYS feel lucky and that this
(the adoption) was meant to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
having a sister who was also Asian and adopted helped me face my differences
with the world around me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am
saddened when I read about adoptees who were mistreated by their adoptive
parents or about those who feel at strong odds with the world they were adopted
into.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I believe any
difficulties I have had growing up as an adopted Korean has been more directly
related to being Korean in America rather than being an adoptee in America, and
this seemed to affect me more when I was a child than now as an adult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As an adult, my concern pertains to any racism that may be directed at my
children. But, I envision I will teach my sons to face it as my mother taught me
to – racism is a reflection of others’ ignorance, not a reflection of me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
