<p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A pawn is as powerful

as a rook after it crosses the river. &quot; -- Chinese Proverb<o:p>

</o:p>

</font></em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">River? My chessboard doesn’t

have a river you say! Welcome to Xiangqi (Xiang = elephant, Qi= game), the

Chinese version of chess. Xiangqi in fact, may be the most popular board game on

the planet. It is China's adaptation of Shatranj, and so is very similar to

Chess. It is a great game, but it is virtually unknown outside of China.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you undertook the task of

designing equipment for Xiangqi with the sole objective of discouraging Chess

players from wanting to learn it, it would be hard to improve on the traditional

Xiangqi equipment. The Chinese have had a thousand years to get used to it.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is played on a 9 by 10

uncheckered board. Xiangqi is played with flat round pieces that are placed on

the corners (as in Go), not in centers of the squares. Each piece has a Chinese

character written on it, identifying the piece. The characters may be different

for the two sides. A new player must learn to read several Chinese characters,

right side up and up side down.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Xiangqi is a much livelier game

than Chess. The game starts with the pawns advanced and spread out. The kings

are already confined to the Palace, which quickens the endgame. The kings are

not allowed to see each other, which gives them a rook-like power. And the

jumping ability of the cannons provides great excitement. A river running

horizontally through the center of the board separates the board into two

territories. Bishops are unable to cross the river. Pawns gain the ability to

move horizontally when they cross the river. Each of the territories has a 3 by

3 area called the Palace. The kings and queens are never permitted to leave the

Palace.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The object of the game is to

checkmate or stalemate the opponent. This is accomplished by:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-outline-level:

1;mso-list:l31 level1 lfo41;tab-stops:list .25in"><font face="Arial" size="2">1.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Placing the opponent in check so that he has no legal move to get out of

the check.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-outline-level:

</span>Stalemating your opponent so that he has no legal move (when you

stalemate your opponent, you win--it is not a draw as in chess).</font></p>
