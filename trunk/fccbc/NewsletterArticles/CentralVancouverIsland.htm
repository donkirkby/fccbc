<h2 align="center">Central &amp; Northern Vancouver Island Update</h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Eleanor Thompson, FCC BC </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the start of 2002, our FCC of central and northern Vancouver Island can
look back at an enjoyable year of activities and support and look forward to
another. There are about 25 families with children from China and 2 on the
starting line waiting to run!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For Chinese New Year 2001, the children of our Nanoose Bay Chinese School
were invited to sing at the Chinese Cultural Society's open house at the Nanaimo
Museum. The girls had their first-ever experience at singing in front of a very
appreciative audience. The open house included musical demonstrations on
authentic instruments, crafts, a lion dance and some interesting displays.
Following the open house, a large group of FCC families met for dinner at a
local Chinese restaurant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chinese School has had to do some changes this year, due to the fact that
4 of our 6 children are now in school. After school on Friday they come
together, ready to play and learn. The introduction of Chinese characters seemed
intimidating at first (only to the parents!) and now is a regular part of the
weekly challenge. The older girls seemed to be really up for it; almost as if it
were a new artform and so much fun! They still all enjoy learning songs and this
year are trying to perfect one about Mama to sing at this year's Chinese New
Year celebration in Nanaimo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We can't say that our children are 'speaking' Chinese yet, but we are pleased
with the exposure to the language and the culture that is happening. As a group,
they are like cousins who would really miss their time together each week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The mainstay of FCC gatherings has been potluck dinners. Other FCC groups
might find this a simple way to get together. We rent the use of a church hall
and kitchen, call the FCC members with details and do potluck. At the dinner we
announce any local news, socialize, let the children just play and bond as a
group and take lots of pictures. We are keeping an album of all our activities
over the years and really enjoy looking back to see how everyone has progressed
and how we, as a group, have built some wonderful friendships, support and
continuity for ourselves and our children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We had a Spring potluck with a visit from a couple who had lived and taught
English in China and then a summer picnic at a local park. We were joined by a
group of FCC parents who had come from out of town. We all have so much in
common, so it makes for a good time for everyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fall brought our now-annual round the bonfire gathering at one family's home.
They have so much for everyone to do, with an outdoor pool, lots of running
space and a fire outside for hotdogs to go along with the usual potluck dinner.
As a special treat they had arranged to have pony rides for the children for an
hour; a great photo opportunity for everyone and fun for the kids!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our pre-Christmas gathering comes before the big rush so we can have a chance
to wish everyone a Merry Christmas, have a wonderful dinner and look at albums,
FCC information and give support to the waiting families. One of the most
enjoyable parts of our gatherings is the opportunity to welcome new little
arrivals. In honour of Bonnie and Dale Wong's new arrival, everyone was able to
sign a card to send with a present from our FCC.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So now we come back full circle to our next gathering which is Chinese New
Year, 2002. We will again meet for the Nanaimo Museum Open House and afterward
for dinner on Feb. 9th. Many FCC families still like to make the trek to the
mainland for the annual FCC celebrations in Vancouver, but with so many families
here, we are able to get together here now as well. HAPPY NEW YEAR from the
Central and Upper Vancouver Island FCC.</font></p>
