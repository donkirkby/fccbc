<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">By Justin Abrioux, FCC BC &amp; NWWA</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I am responding to the article &quot;Aidan goes
to China&quot;. I am the six-year-old boy that went to China to get my sister.
Now that I am 8 years old, I want to tell about how I got my sister.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It all started when we decided that we wanted a
girl from China. So we waited until we got the news about the baby. We looked
at the picture and we all said that she was adorable. I agreed that she was.
When it came to naming her, it was a problem. I kept on saying &quot;How about
Sally, How about Sally?!&quot; We named her Laura, after my mom's friend Laura
who told us about going to get Laura in China. I really couldn't imagine
calling her anything else.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It was my Grandma's idea that if a new member
is added in the family, the whole family should go. And she was right! I was
really excited about going and I couldn't imagine if I were to stay home. I
would have been pleading to go.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">When we got to China, we stayed in a beautiful
hotel with golden dragons, red pillars and lovely tiles all over the place! It
was a beautiful hotel. The first night we were so excited about getting Laura
that we all slept in the same bed and didn't sleep all night! The next day we
went to sign some forms for getting her. After that, we went on a plane to go
to the place to get her. On the way, we saw lots of rice farms and beautiful
scenery. Then we went to the orphanage and got Laura. My job was to give her
the soother, my mom's job was to feed her and dad's job was to take pictures.
It was everyone's job to love her.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It was a great experience going to China.
Besides getting my sister, I really enjoyed seeing a different country. It's
great to have a sister and I must say my family wasn't complete without
her.</FONT></P>
<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Justin, Laura and their parents Janet and
Patrice are members of FCCBC &amp; NWWA. They traveled to China in August
1996.</FONT></I></P>
