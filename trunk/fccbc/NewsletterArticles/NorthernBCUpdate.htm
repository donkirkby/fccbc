<h2 align="center">Northern BC Update</h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Christine James, FCCBC &amp; NWWA</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Northern BC chapter of FCC is primarily based in Prince George, but welcomes
members from throughout the northern half of the province. We meet on an
informal basis, and enjoy seeing the growth and development in our families and
children. There are currently six families in Prince George with children from
China, two families who are &quot;waiting&quot;, and one family in the
application stage. Our children range in age from two to nine years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The FCC group greatly enjoyed participating in the AFABC Christmas party and
sleigh ride held on Sunday Dec 16th at Noah's Ark in Prince George. An informal
potluck and outdoor games day was held on Tuesday January 1st, with five
families and associated friends in attendance. The next event is tentatively
scheduled for Friday February 15th in celebration of Chinese New Year's. This
dinner and entertainment will be held at the China Sail restaurant in Prince
George.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of our school age children has been attending Chinese lessons (through a
local Chinese organization) since last September. Chinese language lessons for
preschool children will begin Monday January 14<sup>th</sup> in the evenings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We welcome further contacts with families throughout the Northern half of the
province. Please note our new e-mail addresses:</font></p>
