<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Dear Friends: Why Do We Need the FCC?</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">From the day in July, 1991, I met my daughter
in the orphanage, I knew I owed it to her to make a peer group for her. She has
made peer groups of her own, of school friends, baseball and soccer team-mates
and the like and she always will. But she will likely also need, someday, to
reach out to other adoptees from China - to give and receive understanding and
encouragement - and of course, <I>Guangsi. </I> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Close FCC friends have told me that they enjoy
a small group of FCC friends, but see little need for an organization. It is
true, small groups of parents who feel a close bond because they went to China
together or something else, do enjoy natural and spontaneous ties. But people
drift away and groups can easily dissolve over time. And what specifically will
attract one of our grown children to another FCC grown child might have little
to do with families we parents enjoy the company of in 1998.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">We FCC members are made up of all sorts of
people with different backgrounds and circumstances. We may have little else in
common. But we do share the desire to bring up happy, healthy and confident
children.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">David Robinson and I are stepping down as
co-chairs at the end of 1998 and I hope to pass on the editorship of the
newsletter to someone soon. But we will continue to be very active in
maintaining our FCC. In the best interests of all of our children, can I appeal
to you to get involved and do the same?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Best wishes,</FONT></P>
