<h2>Preparing children for parent death</h2>
<img id="sidepics" src="../images/sidepics.jpg" alt="happy children">


<p>Jane responds to a parent's concern for her children when she dies:
&quot;I try to prepare them for my eventual loss, but I don't know if it
can be done.&quot;</p>

<p>With this in mind, there ARE some things that I think that we all, as
adoptive parents, should do-- regardless of WHAT our age is. Our
children WILL need us on many levels and it is our job to leave
something behind lest the unthinkable occur and we (or a spouse/partner)
should die.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas:</p>

<p>1) Keep a journal even if you are not faithful about writing daily or
even weekly. This is a gift we can leave for our children-- for it is a
glimpse into our mind, hearts, and souls.</p>

<p>2) Write letters to your children-- at various touchpoints that will
come in their lives: when they graduate from high school, graduation
from college or a trade school, when they marry or commit to a partner,
when they have their own first child, when you die and they are
grappling with how to make peace with the loss of their mom or dad, when
they get their first real job, etc..</p>

<p>3) Write a Grandma or Grandpa letter-- a letter to your grandchildren
to be kept with your will in the event that you die.</p>

<p>4) Purchase or make a special gift for your sons and daughters for
those occasions when you might not be there to celebrate a special
event: a graduation, wedding, birth of a child.</p>

<p>5) Talk with your son or daughter about those items you want them to
have and keep after your death-- what those things have meant to you and
why you wont them to have them to remember you by, and to pass on to
their own children.</p>

<p>6) Make videotapes not only of your children, but of you. Make one
that they can view that tells of your hopes and dreams and unconditional
love for them-- and what you hope that they have learned from you that
will serve them in the future.</p>

<p>7) Designate someone to step in to substitute for you in the event of
your death-- a woman or man whom your child likes and respects; who, in
return, can and will make a permanent investment in your child. Talk
with that person about the things you hope he or she would say to help
guide your child, and those things they can and should say so that your
child will still feel your guidance in their life.</p>

<p>8) Put yourself in your child's dreams. Talk about dreams-- how we
can be with or hear someone in our dreams when they are not present in
our lives. Talk about how we can turn to our dreams and try to plan TO
dream so that we can feel someone's presence in our lives when we miss
them or need them to be with us.</p>

<p>9) We have a family tradition that we borrowed from a Native American
(New Mexican Acoma) tribe. When we sweep up our floors or carpets, we
always leave a little dirt behind the door-- we don't sweep that out. We
do this because we want to keep the footsteps of those who have walked
in that earth in order to keep them with us in spirit. (we also have
brought some Korean soil and Chinese soil home with us and sprinkled it
behind the door-- so our kids can walk in their native soil-- the soil
of their ancestors). We talk about this occasionally-- reminding them of
all those they have known and loved who have walked through those doors
and whose presence is still with us and that OUR spirits will always
remain with each of them no matter what-- even after we die.</p>

<p>10) Explore the topic of death with your children. We can better
handle that which we have faced together directly. We also read an
occasional book about death and dying.</p>

<p>11) The death of a pet is a Teachable Moment-- an opportunity to
grieve together and come through the tragedy with those we love. Loss is
universal-- none of us gets to escape losing those we love. Talk about
ways that being interconnected helps. Help your child recognize and
claim his or her coping skills. Help your child see that while grieving
is so very hard, feelings DO lessen and what is left are the sweet
memories and the gains of having had that pet in one's life-- not just
the wrenching sadness.</p>
