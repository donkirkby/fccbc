### Annual FCC Family Day &amp; Report to Members - Sat Nov 8, 2008 ###
- 10 am - 1 pm 
- Vancity International Film Theatre
- 1181 Seymour St. (at Davie), Vancouver

Join us at a new venue - the luxurious Vancity
Theatre. Enjoy a China-related film in state-of-the-art 
theatre conditions and have a say in what's
happening to FCC BC. Experience spectacular
imagery of China on the big screen and take a
walk through China's oldest and some say most
spectacular village, the Ancient City of Phoenix. These films are appropriate
for all ages; we'll even have a balcony area reserved for kids deemed old
enough by their parents.
Not forgetting the wee ones, they'll have the use of an open play area. Details
will be posted on our website. To help cover costs, there'll be a nominal
charge, say $4 per adult; children free.
Please pre-register (e-mail 
as space is limited due to theatre seating.
