<h2>Family Match</h2>
<img id="sidepics" src="images/sidepics.jpg" alt="happy children">

<p>FCC BC has collaborated with two local agencies to establish a Family
Match Program, giving our FCC families an opportunity to develop a
personal friendship with a Chinese family.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful way to bring Chinese people and culture into our
lives; on a personal level and at our own individual family's pace. This
is not a group event nor a structured activity.</p>

<p>This Family Match program is designed to match your family with a
Chinese family with whom you then arrange the timing and nature of your
get-togethers. Sometimes these are planned outings, sometimes these
get-togethers take place at one another's home. They may include all
family members or only a few. It's up to you. It's about taking time to
introduce your family and your lifestyle to your new friends, and being
open to discovering who and what they are all about.</p>

<p>This program is about reciprocity and a mutual exchange of cultures.</p>

<p>These new immigrant families are from all walks of life, with parents
and children ready to make friends. Many are highly educated and have
left behind professional careers. In addition to the many formal
programs and services they are involved in, helping them to adjust and
integrate successfully into Canadian society, they are looking for
personal and informal connections as well.</p>

<p>They are interested in making friends with a Canadian family with
whom and through whom they can become increasingly familiar with
Canadian customs and traditions, informally pick up on proceedure and
protocol, and practice speaking and perfecting their English.</p>

<p>Through this Family Match Program these new immigrant families have
become familiar with 'Families With Children From China', our
transracial and adoptive family makeup, and our interest in developing
and enhancing our Chinese cultural competency. They are pleased and
eager to introduce our families to Chinese nuance, customs, and traditions, and express respect and a kindred spirit for our Chinese
adopted children.</p>

<p>If your family would like to participate, contact
