<p>Join the <a href="http://www.bcadoption.com/site_page.asp?pageid=81">Adoptive 
Families Association of BC</a> in the Christmas festivities and in finding homes 
for kids in need! AFABC celebrated Christmas early in 2005, wrapping up the IKEA 
Christmas Tree Sale fundraising event four days early due to a tree sell out. We 
raised $5,500 for the Family for Every Child program by selling 4,000 trees! 
Come out this season and help make a difference in kids' lives. It's an easy way 
to deck the halls and do something important!</p>
<p>Volunteers are needed, so please call Susan
at 604.320.7330x104 or e-mail <script type="text/javascript">
