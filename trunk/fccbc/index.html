<h3>Christmas Ice Skate - Sunday, December 20</h3>
<p class="fineprint">from the <a href="events.html">events</a> page</p>
<ul>
<li>12:00 pm - 1:00 pm</li>
<li>Kerrisdale Cyclone Taylor Arena</li>
<li>5670 East Boulevard Vancouver, BC
(Corner of East Boulevard and 41st, behind McDonalds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy a rest from the bustling activity of Seasonal shopping!
We're pleased to invite all FCCBC members and families to a private skating party.
Skate the ice, catch up with friends, and maybe sneak in a carriage ride with 
Santa on the local high street.</p>

<p>Please remember to bring your skates, but if you don't have any, then rentals 
can be had for $3 a pair. The skate rental shop is open 15 minutes prior to and 
following the skate (11:45am to 1:15pm only). If you don't skate, come for the 
company, or feel free to use all the teaching aids that will be available - 
they're meant for the kids, but Eamon's been known to use the ice equivalent 
of an "easy-walker"!</p>

<p>Helmets are highly recommended - not just for kids. 
Noggins are not tougher than the ice - no matter how old you are. Bike helmets, 
snowboarding helmets etc work, but we also have access to some hockey helmets 
at the arena too if you don't own anything.</p>
