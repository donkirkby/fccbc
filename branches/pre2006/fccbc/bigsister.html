<p>The FCC Big Sister Mentor Program called 'Connecting Little Sisters To Their Roots', is developing quickly into a fabulous program.  It is designed to match our Chinese adopted daughters between the ages of 7 and 13, with a Chinese Big Sister for a one year duration (this of course may be extended).  Big and Little Sisters meet together one on one once a week, and join the other Matches in a larger cultural and social group once a month.

<p>The goal of the Program is to offer our Chinese adopted daughters an opportunity to develop a personal and meaningful relationship with someone of their own race and birth heritage, and to participate in activities and events designed to enhance their Chinese cultural competency. Having significant others in addition to family members,  to assist our daughters in making sense of and integrating their dual identity, is of paramount importance as they approach their adolescent years.

<p>Selected adult women of Chinese heritage, language, and culture, have been recruited and trained to become volunteer Big Sister Mentors to Little Sisters.  All volunteer mentors working with with our chldren have successfully completed a Criminal Record Clearance and have fulfilled the requirements of the Mentor Training Program.  All volunteer mentors continue to receive supervision by the program's professional team of child and family counsellor, cultural, adoption, and social, worker staff throughout the Match.

<p>The Big Sister Mentor Program includes planned group activities such as hands on demonstrations of Chinese fine arts, attending performing arts, participating in cultural and social events, and going on field trips.  In addition, there are small groops planned for Little Sisters to learn about the city, province, and people where they each come from in China, through arts and crafts, chinese cartography, history, and geography. And, improvisational games, role playing, and arts and crafts to explore issues of race and racism, and what it means to be part of a minority group, and part of a transracial family.  It promises to be a fun and enriching program, and one that our daughters may return to again and again.

<p>Funding for the Big Sister Mentor Program during its first year of operation has been made possible through private foundation monies and through S.U.C.C.E.S.S. and Big Sisters sponsorship.

<p>You are encouraged to register your daughter early to ensure her a place in the program; there are a limited number of matches available.  For those chldren now younger than 7, indicating an interest, and placing her name on a wait list is recommended.

<p>Start date: Spring/Summer 04.

<p>(N.B. The Big Sister Mentor Program will go forward only if enough interest is indicated)
