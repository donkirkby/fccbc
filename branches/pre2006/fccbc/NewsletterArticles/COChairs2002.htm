<h2 align="center">Co-Chairs Report Annual General meeting November 17 2001</h2>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Wanda Pierson and Connie Munro, FCCBC &amp; NWWA, outgoing chairs</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are pleased to present our report for the past 12 months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chinese New Year was again a major event for our organization. A successful
lunch with entertainment was held January 20, in the auditorium of the Chinese
Cultural Centre. Approximately 265 people attended.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On February 3 2001, David Robinson and Jackie Wong hosted a coffee party for
waiting parents on behalf of the FCC at their home. This was done through
contact with Bonnie Wong, the facilitator for many China adoptions taking place
out of the Lower Mainland. A doctor, who has adopted a daughter from China,
spoke about medical issues traveling parents might anticipate, and some parents
whose adoptions were completed, talked about their experiences. This was part of
an attempt by the FCC to be more proactive in reaching out and encouraging
waiting parents participation in our organization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In April both co-chairs met with representative of the Chinese Cultural
Centre. This resulted in two new initiatives for the FCC.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We now have a Volunteer Grandparents program where Chinese seniors meet with
FCC families and provide some cultural and language contact for our children.
This group had their first meeting October 29. Thanks go to Lorna Hunter for
guiding this project. Interested parents are encouraged to contact Lorna Hunter
who is organizing this program for FCC.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second program to evolve following the April 
  meeting was the cultural camp for children held from July 16th to July 27th 
  at the Chinese Cultural Centre. The childrens’ schedule involved exposure to 
  Mandarin, calligraphy, crafts, music, puppet shows, games, making Chinese food, 
  storytelling and various field trips. This was an ambitious undertaking by the 
  Chinese Cultural Centre intended to benefit English speaking children of Chinese 
  origin between the ages of 3 and 7 years. They are willing to repeat the effort 
  in 2002, but we clearly will great more enrollment than the 16 children who 
  attended the 2001 program if we expect the Chinese Cultural Centre to continue 
  to provide this program. Parents are encouraged to complete the survey regarding 
  culture camps, included with their Autumn newsletter, and return it to Wanda 
  Pierson.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On July 8, the FCC held a successful summer picnic 
  at Ryall Park in New Westminster. The park’s spray pool, toddler area and climbing 
  web proved very popular. The picnic was moved from June to July this year in 
  an effort to capture better weather. Thanks go to Kathy Coleman for her work 
  in chairing the Summer Picnic committee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Part of the role of the FCC executive is to field questions from persons
contemplating adoption from China. Several informal discussions and meetings
with prospective adoptive parents took place during the year. On June 23, Wanda
met with a waiting parents group, arranged by the Ministry of Children and
Family Development. On November 7, Connie met with a waiting parents group, all
dealing with Sunrise Agency and who have commenced regular meetings in a space
at the Vancouver Public Library.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The executive held pot luck dinner meetings on February 10 and May 12 to get
to know each other better and to supplement their usual communication which is
largely conducted by email.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both of us, Connie and Wanda are stepping down as co-chairs at the November
17 Annual General Meeting. We wish the new executive well.</font></p>
