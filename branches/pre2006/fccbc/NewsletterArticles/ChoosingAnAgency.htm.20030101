<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">There is an excellent article published by Mike
Weaver setting out the considerations in selecting an agency in the United
States which can be
<A HREF="http://www.catalog.com/cgibin/var/fwcfc/agencychoice.htm">found on the
Internet</A>. Please bear in mind that US agencies have a long history, and
many of them are very large. Thus, some of the considerations set out in this
article are not wholly applicable when looking at agencies in BC. </FONT></P>
<H3>ARE YOU RESTRICTED TO USING AN AGENCY IN THE AREA WHERE YOU LIVE?</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The answer is no. <B>Choices, Sunrise, Hope and
Family Services</B>, say they cover the whole province. This is encouraging as
it gives families options. Notwithstanding, I question whether an agency can
provide an effective service everywhere. I suggest families ask agencies
whether their representatives visit their locality, (and if not whether
additional costs or incidental expenses will be incurred) the availability of
social workers to conduct the homestudy where they live, and how the
educational component of the adoption is to be handled. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Family Services</B> mainly serve the Lower
Mainland but do have some clients on the Island, and in other parts of BC.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Community Services</B> focus on Northern BC
and so far have had minimal involvement with adoptions from China; they hope
that will change. </FONT></P>
<H3>EDUCATION </H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Anyone adopting inter-country will have to
satisfy an educational component imposed under the Adoption Act. How that is
administered and interpreted by each agency varies considerably. The quality of
what is offered may also vary. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Choices and the Adoption Centre</B> arrange
for the social worker doing the homestudy to deliver the educational component.
<B>The Adoption Centre</B> developed this to serve its far-flung clientele in
remoter parts of BC where it was impractical and costly for families to attend
a course in Kelowna. <B>The Adoption Centre</B> allows the social worker to
tailor make the educational components according to the particular needs and
circumstances of the family. It can take into account the extent to which a
family has already explored adoption issues, and then concentrate on the issues
or matters that really require some addressing. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">In the Lower Mainland, <B>Hope</B> have a 1-day
orientation on a Saturday and a 3-day educational course during the workweek
(the latter is once every 3 months). For those with jobs or children, this
attendance can cause obvious problems as well as additional cost. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Family Services</B> have 3 daily sessions
each of which are held on a Saturday (two run internally, and one run by
AFABC). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Sunrise</B> request their clients attend
courses run by the AFABC which are held at various times in Surrey and Kelowna.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Community Services</B> with the help of
AFABC have developed an educational package involving self-study. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The content of the educational component
therefore varies in each agency, so I suggest you find out in advance what it
is and consider if it is appropriate for you. For those doing a second adoption
through an agency, check if you have to fulfill the same course content and if
some dispensation is given. </FONT></P>
<H3>COSTS </H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The fees and expenses of each agency vary for
adopting in China, although the services of each agency will generally be very
similar. Each agency has its own price structure. Some of the agencies do
provide Fee Schedules specifically for adoptions from China but as they may
contain a number of variable fees, a written estimate taking into account your
family and circumstances may be a good idea. For agencies that do not provide a
full schedule of fees and costs for the adoption from beginning to end, a
written estimate is desirable prior to proceeding further. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The Fee Schedule put together by <B>Family
Services</B> for an adoption from China is clear and easy to understand. It
sets out all fees, and costs such as their Consultant, incidental expenses paid
in Canada and the estimated costs of the trip to and in China. Other agencies
would, I think do well to follow their example. <B>Sunrise's</B> schedule is
detailed and has US dollar expenses as well as Canadian dollar expenses but
does not give a total estimate in Canadian dollars. <B>Hope</B> set out their
fees and those of the Consultant but do not set out Canadian and Chinese
expenses. I note <B>Hope</B> charge extra for expenses such as couriers, faxes,
long distance calls, translations incurred on your behalf plus a 12%
administration fee. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Choices</B> inform me that they do not at
present have a Fee Schedule for China adoptions but will be producing one in
due course. The list of fees (effective June 1998) I picked up from them
(applicable to domestic or inter-country) simply describes a variety of
services, which may or may not be applicable to a particular applicant. They
state there is a 10% handling fee surcharge when collecting fees for the
facilitator (the Consultant). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The Fee Schedule of the <B>Adoption Centre</B>
is a general one for inter-country and inter-provincial adoptions. I have no
Fee Schedule from <B>Community Services</B>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>Choices</B> who recently changed their
Consultant, estimate the total fees and expenses for an adoption from China at
between $25,000 to $30,000 for 2 people. This is exorbitant compared to the
estimated fees and expenses of <B>Sunrise</B> and <B>Family Services</B> of
about $19,000. <B>Hope</B> and the <B>Adoption Centre</B> do not provide total
estimated fees and expenses in their Fee Schedules, but from what I can make
out, their total costs will not be far removed from <B>Sunrise</B> and the
<B>Adoption Centre</B>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">For those intrepid few who wish to do it alone
without a Consultant, there is a saving but this has to be outweighed against
the time, effort and anxiety of going it alone. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I encourage you to go over any Fee Schedule
carefully. If you have any doubts as to what a charge is for, then ask and
satisfy yourself it is appropriate. If you are unclear what the total fees and
expenses will be, get a written estimate (inclusive of taxes) in advance of
signing up. I believe that <B>Family Services</B> are the only agency not to
charge GST on their fees. </FONT></P>
<H3>CONSULTANTS/FACILITATORS</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Most agencies use the term facilitator, which
was in use prior the Adoption Act. I prefer to use the term Consultant. The
Consultant will keep the agency and its clientele informed of China's
requirements for the adoption and will liase with the family on what is
required and help them through the process, including attending to travel
arrangements when the adoption finally takes place in China. The agencies, with
the exception of <B>Choices</B>, have a contract with Tribo Services (Bonnie
Wong). <B>Choices</B> have a contract with Howard Yang and are looking at
contracting with others. <B>Community Services</B> also leave their options
open to use other Consultants. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">If your Consultant is Tribo Services then
Bonnie Wong will accompany the group of families adopting and look after any
problems arising. If you use <B>Choices</B>, I am not sure whom, if anyone
accompanies you. I believe <B>Choices</B> have agents in China who will look
after you. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The experience of a Consultant is vital, and
you should satisfy yourself <B>before signing up</B> with an agency that the
Consultant has the requisite experience. You can always check with other
families who have been through the adoption process (contact any FCCBC &amp;
NWW member), or alternatively contact AFABC. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Fees of a Consultant and expenses in BC and
China are a consideration as these may vary in terms of amount and when payment
is made. Check when fees and expenses have to be paid. On no account should a
family pay the US$3000 donation until they collect the child in China. </FONT> 
</P>
<H3>SOCIAL WORKERS</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Agencies generally have their own social
workers on staff or have arrangements with certain social workers who can do
your homestudy. If you wish to have a particular social worker (you may have
been recommended one by a friend who has been through the process, or wish to
use the social worker you had on a previous adoption) check with the agencies
if you can use that social worker. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Find out which social workers are available
through the agencies as you may have a preference for some reason. Also, check
the availability of any particular social worker, and how long it may take for
that social worker to complete the homestudy. Always keep in mind that your
discussions with the social worker are of a very personal nature. You want a
social worker that you get along with. Most families I have spoken with have
had good relationships with their social worker, but occasionally there has
been a social worker that has been far from satisfactory. If possible, check
out whichever social worker is suggested in advance of signing up with an
agency. An agency should be able to put you in touch with others (with their
consent) who have used that social worker. I have fond memories of our social
worker, Cynthia Cherry. </FONT></P>
<H3>ADOPTION PROCESS</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I am frequently asked how long will the whole
adoption process take. This will depend on a number of factors (particularly in
terms of the processing by China) but as a rule of thumb, you can expect the
process from the time you first register with an agency to the time you have
returned to BC with your child to take about 1 year 2 months or more. </FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The initial processing of papers and home study
in BC will take about 3 to 4 months (the time element depends in part on you
getting the papers together quickly and in part on the efficiency of the
agency.) Once your home study is almost completed, check with the agency (or
Bonnie Wong if she is the consultant being used), when the next notarisation of
documents takes place. The reason for this is that you will go in a group to
China and documents of the whole group are notarised, sent to the Chinese
Embassy, and returned to the agency who then send the papers to Victoria (for
onward transmission to China through the National Adoption desk) as a batch. If
you miss that notarisation date, you may have to wait another 2 months or more
for the next notarisation. The process of notarisation, authentication etc to
time of the documents being received in China will take 4 to 6 weeks.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Once the papers are in China, expect to wait
about 7 to 8 months before you get a proposal letter from China. This will go
via the Ministry to your agency. Occasionally there have been undue delays in
the Ministry and/or the agency in sending on this letter. Undue delay at this
stage can cause problems. As the proposal letters are generally sent out as a
group, if your agency is using Bonnie Wong as its consultant, they can find out
from her when the proposal letter is in the pipeline, as she will have heard
from others who have received their proposal. Make sure the agency tells you.
Then if there is undue delay, request the agency to make enquiries. Some do not
like doing this but you are the client and in my view you should insist if
there is undue delay. If the problem lies with Victoria, and your agency cannot
provide any or any adequate explanation for the delay, telephone Victoria and
find out the cause of the delay for yourself. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I also recommend that you ask your agency when
they received the letter of proposal. Some agencies have occasionally sat on a
proposal for a while. I see no reason why the agency cannot telephone you the
day they receive the proposal letter and I believe that most do. There will be
a delay of 2 or so days in the agency sending you the letter, as the letter has
to be translated from Chinese into English.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Once you have accepted the letter of proposal,
expect to wait for about 6 to 8 weeks before you fly to China and collect your
child.</FONT></P>
<H3>WORKING WITH AN AGENCY</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">At the end of the day, you have to be
comfortable with the agency you select. I recommend you approach different
agencies to get a feel of how each operates and how you get along with people
from each agency. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Do not be afraid to ask questions. Look for
straightforward answers to your questions. </FONT></P>
<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Cost is only one factor in deciding which
agency to choose from. Each family has to decide for itself about the
educational component. While a 3-day course during the week may sound onerous
to some, there are families I have spoken to who have attended that course and
enjoyed it, not just for the content but also for meeting other families
adopting from elsewhere and sharing their thoughts. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Where you live should not dictate which agency
you choose. You should check out other agencies. Most important is getting a
Consultant who has proven experience with adoptions in China, and having a
comfortable fit with the agency you choose. </FONT></P>
<H3>PROBLEMS/COMPLAINTS</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This September I met with <B>Cheryl Fix</B>
from the <B>Ministry of Adoptions</B> in Victoria. She has very kindly given me
her name and telephone number (250-387-2281) and said that anyone using an
agency can contact her if they have any problems or complaints with an agency
or the Ministry. (If someone does not for any reason wish to give their name to
her, that is fine with her.) She did make it clear that where appropriate, she
would encourage people to resolve their problems directly with an agency, but
where for some reason that cannot be done, then she will try and assist.

<H3>FEEDBACK </H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Feedback from families going through agencies
is essential to get an idea of how things are working and what changes or
improvements families would like to see. I therefore urge families to write to
<a HREF="mailto:fcc_bc@yahoo.ca">FCCBC &amp; NWW </a>with their comments and
suggestions, so FCC can take steps, where necessary, to advocate on adoptive
families' behalf. </FONT></P>
