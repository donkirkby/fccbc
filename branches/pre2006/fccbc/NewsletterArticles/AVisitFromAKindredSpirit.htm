<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Those of you who were able to meet Amy Klatzkin
on January 15, at the CCC, found in her, a kindred spirit. Amy is an FCC mom
who lives in San Francisco. She is also the editor of San Francisco&#146;s FCC
newsletter and the editor of the marvelous book, &#147;A Passage to the Heart:
Writings from Families with Children from China&#148; (see review and purchase
details in this issue of FOF). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Amy came to Vancouver to talk about local
FCC&#146;s working together for the common good of all families and for the
children we left behind in Chinese orphanages. I know from a long-standing
email acquaintance with Amy that she was keen to visit Vancouver, the other
really Chinese city in North America. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Amy introduced her presentation with an
overview of Adoption in China in the 1990s, the text of which follows. We saw a
video which showed conditions in Chinese orphanages, devastated by recent
floods and improvements that have made possible by FCC&#146;s in the United
States. I realized, more than ever, that we in BC need to do more to
help the orphans left behind. We are presently exploring options and you will
hear more from us in future on this subject. In the mean time, there is a
sure-fire way you can help kids in orphanages. Buy a copy of &#147;A Passage to
the Heart&#148;. The publisher of the book, Yeong and Yeong, is generously
donating 10% of sales proceeds directly to orphanages in China to improve the
lives of children housed there. </FONT></P>
