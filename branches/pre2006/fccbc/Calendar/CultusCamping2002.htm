    <h2 align="center">CAMPING WEEKEND AT CULTAS LAKE ON SATURDAY AUGUST 17</h2><p>
     <font face="Arial" size="2">Would you and your family be interested in joining us in a FCC Camping
     weekend at Cultus Lake (near Abbotsford and Chilliwack) that promises fun
     and adventures for children and parents alike? We suggest Entrance Bay
     campsite, or alternatively the Delta Grove Campground or other campgrounds
     at Cultus Lake if those are full.<p>
     The cost is $18.50 per night per family (2 adults and 2 children, one car),
     with a possibility of 2 families sharing a site (for a total of up to 8
     people per site, including children, and two cars) subject to an additional
     fee.  There is a reservation fee of $6.47 per night.   Double sites are also
     available.  More details may be obtained at the <a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/fees/fees.htm">BC
     Government site</a>.</font>
     <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Reservations should be made by each family, three months prior to the
     camping trip, preferably on the morning of Friday May 17th, starting at 7:30
     am to ensure getting a site. If you do not book on that day, the campsite
     may be full if you try and book later.  For online reservation, consult
     the <a href="http://www.discovercamping.ca">Discover Camping web site</a>. When making the reservation, identify yourself as an FCC family and ask the
     attendant, if possible, to assign your family a site close to other FCC
     families.<p>
     Some families will reserve for more than one night. Saturday, August 17th is
     the day and night planned for FCC families to meet.<p>
     Cultus Lake located nearby, offers many services and recreational options.
     There are hot showers and flush toilets!  David Robinson best highlights the
     campground in the following paragraph:<p>
     &quot;There are several camp grounds some by the lake and some in wooded areas.
     The sites vary in size. Some sites offer space for 2 or more families.
     Booking is usually 3 months in advance.&quot;<p>
     There are shops in the vicinity so those who like their coffee and newspaper
     in the morning can rest easy. There are also a variety of restaurants
     including quite a good Chinese one.  Those that like McDonald's for
     breakfast only have to go a few kilometres for this! Lots of activities for
     young children to blow off steam: playgrounds, mini golf, crazy golf, water
     slides (more for kids 7 and up), go carts, horse riding and of course
     swimming and boating in the lake.  If it is raining, there is Chilliwack and
     Abbotsford nearby with facilities to offer. Abbotsford has a fun wave pool.<p>
     The beauty of Cultus Lake is the fact it is relatively near and has
     something to offer everyone.  It's a lovely area and offers some nice walks.
     If people do not want to camp, there are nearby motels and the like.
     Alternatively people can come up for the day.  There is a central notice
     board, so we can post notices of any group activities.<p>
     Once we know how many campers will join our group, we can plan together a
     pot luck or barbecue for the Saturday night.<p>
     Please mark it on your calendar, and let me know by email if you are
     planning on joining the FCC Camping Weekend.<p>
     Warmest regards to everyone.<p>
