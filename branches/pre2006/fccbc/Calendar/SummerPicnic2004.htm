This year we have a wonderful entertainer for children and adults alike who will do face painting, a magic show and more.  There will also be the exciting addition of a soccer game for those 6 and older - and you guessed it - parents on one team - kids on the other!  Should be loads of fun.  The entertainer will perform between 11:15 and 1:15 with the soccer game getting under way at 1:30 pm.  The soccer game is for children 6 and older

The cost will be $7.00 for member families and $12.00 for non-member families.  We would encourage all families, including those waiting to travel to China, to come and participate.  It's a wonderful way to meet new friends and renew acquaintainces.  We will have name tags this year and will identify in a special way those families who are waiting to travel.  If you see one of these tags, please take a moment to make these new families feel particularly welcome.

Also, the "book program" initiated by Julia Olsen was such a success last year we are repeating it.  Please encourage your children to choose books they want to donate and they will be sold for $1.00 each with all proceeds going to orphanages in China for the children still in care.  This is another wonderful way to show our children that we continue to support their birth country and the orphanages.

Please remember to bring your own lunch, although this year we will have some special "treats" donated by a local community store and bakery.  The excitement continues!
