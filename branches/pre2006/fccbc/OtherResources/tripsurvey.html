<h2>Survey on organising trips to China</h2>
<p>
Dear FCC member,
</p>
<p>
Many families with children adopted from China have indicated an
interest in returning for a visit to China with their family.  These
"homeland visits" can take many forms, but usually include sightseeing
in China's big cities and a visit to the orphanage where your child
lived.
</p>
<p>
FCC BC would like to assist families in arranging these trips. FCC
Toronto have had an initial meeting with Tour East holidays, a large
travel company with offices in Toronto and Vancouver that has worked
closely with the Chinese Cultural Centre of Greater Toronto.  (More
information about Tour East is at
http://www.toureast.com/information/AboutUs.asp)
</p>
<p>
The people at Tour East apparently are very enthusiastic about working
with FCCs throughout Canada, and have told FCC Toronto they can put
together reasonably priced packages to China that are customized to suit
our needs.
</p>
<p>
Additionally we wish to see whether there are families, who would like
to use the services of someone such as Bonnie Wong (who is a Consultant
to most of the Agencies in BC) to tailor make their trip to China.
Bonnie can (depending on numbers) still get flight discounts and hotel
discounts. We have yet to find out what exactly she can do.
</p>
<p>
In order to start planning this project, FCC BC require some information
on the level of interest among our members and non members, and types of
trips that people want.  Please take a couple of minutes to fill out the
survey below and return it to David Robinson as soon as possible by
e-mail or post or fax by February 1 2005. If you know families who
adopted from China who are not members of FCC BC, can you please pass
this survey onto them to complete.

do not include those in your answers below.)
