North American Council on Adoptable Children (NACAC)<br>
Annual Conference in Vancouver August 7-9, 2003<br>
<br>
<p>Notes prepared by <a href="mailto:swhan@shaw.ca">Steve Whan</a></p>

There were far more useful sessions than any one (or even two) people could attend. Fortunately the various talks and workshops were taped and the AFABC will have the complete audio library available for their members.<br>
<br>
I split my time between sessions related to building successful support groups and those that dealt with transracial adoption. These are the highlights of the sessions I attended. Where I have additional resource material I'll make note of it. Hopefully others that attended the NACAC conference will also provide their perspective on the various sessions.<br>

<b>1J - Parent Groups for Today's Families</b><br>
The needs and realities of today's families have changed, and parent groups must keep pace. For those interested in increasing parent group membership and especially participation, this workshop will present ideas for rejuvenating your group and re-energizing members.<br>
Judith Ashton, New York State Citizens' Coalition for Children<br>
<br>
·	We need to learn to how to deliver in a modern world<br>
·	We have to sell something that someone wants to buy<br>
·	We need to meet the members needs in a meaningful way<br>
<br>
Parent Group Needs:<br>
·	Increase membership, participation, commitment<br>
·	Increase attendance at meetings; revitalize; become stronger<br>
·	Retain members - -why are we losing members?<br>
·	Recruit more people to take on responsibilities in the group<br>
·	How to cultivate new leaders<br>
·	New approaches, new blood<br>
·	How to get people to give time (not just money)<br>
·	Burnout prevention for present leaders<br>
·	How to help experienced volunteers/leaders learn to let go, share power<br>
·	How to &quot;perpetuate history&quot; of the group<br>
·	How to convince families that they need the group throughout life<br>
·	Ways to evaluate performance<br>
<br>
Context/2003 Realities:<br>
·	No matter how large the group, only a very few people do all the work<br>
·	Most activities don't need large numbers; all activities need a &quot;critical mass&quot;. For example, six people to do a garage sale. If only four are interested it may have been the wrong activity!<br>
·	Status quo will be the death of any group<br>
·	Change is inevitable. Nothing stays the same!<br>
<br>
What do people get from involvement? -&gt; self-interest has to be fulfilled<br>
·	Sense of security - benefit from other's experience<br>
·	Validation/affirmation - we can talk in far better detail to total strangers who are adoptive parents then our own family and friends<br>
·	Recognition<br>
·	Pride in accomplishment<br>
·	Being in charge, power, control, authority<br>
·	Skill development and application (e.g. organizing, PR, leadership skills, etc.)<br>
·	Increase/enhance parenting skills, knowledge of adoption dynamics<br>
·	Support - trust - non-judgmental acceptance<br>
·	Outlet outside of children and child rearing<br>
·	Way to develop friendships that will benefit children and parents<br>
·	Volunteering = a way to get involved<br>
·	To model for children the value of making a contribution<br>
·	Need to give back<br>
·	&quot;Making a difference&quot;<br>
·	Way to validate, affirm adoption<br>
·	Family activities with other adopted children<br>
<br>
Evaluation is critical to see if we are meeting self-interests and needs. Sure, we have a huge crowd show up, but did they take away anything useful? Success is not just having a good turn out.<br>
<br>
Evaluation:<br>
·	Telephone interviews<br>
·	Postal survey<br>
·	Email survey<br>
·	Evaluation forms<br>
·	Group discussions<br>
·	&quot;Focus groups&quot;<br>
·	other<br>
<br>
More:<br>
·	meetings: gripes get first 15 minutes; rest of the meeting to do something to solve one of the gripes<br>
·	plan activities not just for &quot;support&quot;. Need a lot of activities to meet the self-interests of a diverse group of people<br>
·	co-chairing gives life to the group - can feed off each other<br>
·	have a group discussion at the end of the meeting to record what worked and what didn't for next meeting<br>
·	bring in new blood!<br>
·	Why are we having a Christmas party year after year if no one wants to help? Maybe Spring would be better and suddenly the group is rejuvenated (i.e. nobody really wanted the party at Christmas.) Participation getting lower didn't mean people didn't want a party, just a Christmas party! You have to ask the group.<br>
·	Include something for the kids on the web site<br>
·	Use AOL instant messaging for quarterly meetings (especially to include people not in the city)<br>
·	Why do kids come? Because a friend was there! Design programs to build connectedness amongst the children.<br>
·	Teens - video games & pizza to draw the kids in. They'll start sharing stories with each other once they sit down to eat…<br>
<br>
<b>INST-10 - Innovative Adoptive and Foster Parent Group Programs</b><br>
This institute will provide information on innovative ways to establish parent support groups. The speakers will discuss leadership, how to develop a plan through needs assessment, and how to create a vision statement, goals, and a plan of action. What are some creative ways steps support groups can take to stay alive and be proactive? What resources are available from NACAC to support parent groups?<br>

<b>2J - Waiting Parent Support Group Model</b><br>
This workshop will teach participants how to facilitate a waiting parent support group. Participants who are waiting for a successful adoption will leave this workshop with all the tools needed to start their own support group or rejuvenate their existing group.<br>
Nikki Hemstad-Leete & Dianna Mortensen, Adoptive Families Association of British Columbia<br>
Why start one?<br>
·	Insight<br>
·	To prepare families for what to expect<br>
·	Calming anxiety<br>
·	Share strategies<br>
·	See that it does work!<br>
·	Build relationships<br>
·	Strength in numbers<br>
·	Reduce isolation<br>
·	Parent centered information<br>
<br>
Main issue: confidentiality. Agencies will not give is names and contact information. We should be establishing a relationship with the agencies in BC so they tell perspective adoptive families about our waiting parent support group. <br>
We need to be very clear with the agencies that we are not a support group facilitated by professionals (a role the agencies hopefully fulfill), but are a self-help group, facilitated by people who have been there already. That is, the self-help group can provide people who have been through it and offer help during the long wait. What they can't do is fix what's wrong with the system or problems with a social worker, agency, etc.) other than offering strategies that may have worked in the past).<br>
You can't make someone participate if they don't want to, but they at least know we're there if they ever need us.<br>
Have a topic to draw interest to the meetings.<br>
Recruitment:<br>
·	Five agencies in BC<br>
·	Press release in community papers to announce the group; email to all media contacts at one time <br>
·	Word of mouth<br>
·	Same place, same time every month (that way people can find you)<br>
·	Posters at kids consignment stores<br>
·	Libraries<br>
·	The agencies have to realize what we do is totally different (not support, but self-service)<br>
·	Have a wine and cheese with agencies and social workers once a year<br>
<br>
Confidentiality:<br>
·	One person has to be in charge of this piece; talk about it at the beginning of each meeting e.g. &quot;what's said here, stays here&quot;<br>
·	Set the boundaries<br>
·	Don't disclose outside of meeting unless you have specific permission<br>
·	Remember though that you do have a moral and legal responsibility if harm or abuse involved<br>
·	Pass out paper to solicit name, phone, email -&gt; has to be voluntary<br>
<br>
Some advice about giving advice:<br>
·	Have to be careful. Can't solve people's problems for them, but can offer options and suggestion to try<br>
·	Help them set realistic goals and expectations<br>
·	Give them hope<br>
·	Provide ideas for innovative parenting<br>
·	Advice giving should avoid criticism, yet provide feedback<br>
·	Avoid pontification, yet offer alternative opinions<br>
·	Avoid dictating, yet provide encouraging suggestions<br>
<br>
Have some backup topics e.g.:<br>
·	What are you going to name your child<br>
·	Dealing with Grandma<br>
·	School issues<br>
·	Bring a parent or other person in (social worker, older adoptee, doctor to discuss special needs, etc.)<br>
<br>
<b>3F - Birth Country Language and Culture: The Advantages of Early Exposure</b><br>
The presenters will discuss their experiences and some of the theory underlying the early exposure of international adoptees to their birth country's language. They will also offer practical tips on how to start language groups and summer day camp programs. The format will include lecture, slides, video clips, and a brief demonstration of teaching methods.<br>
Johan Vink, Baba Panda Day Camp, Ontario o Catherine Bickley & Tracy Hsu, Riverdale Mandarin Playgroup, Ontario<br>
<br>
Johan Vink is an FCC father in Toronto. He created and still runs the Baba Panda Day Camp. He says that he is constantly going up to Chinese people and initiating conversions with them about the camp. Not surprisingly, there is an outpouring of support for FCC members that are asking for cultural assistance. Now in the forth year, Johan is able to run the camp for three solid weeks in summer. He has built up a variety of resources in the Chinese community who participate in the camp. The kids have so much fun they want to come back the next year.<br>
<br>
Here is some info in the program from the FCC Toronto web site:<br>
<br>
<p>
Baba Panda Day Camp returns again for another summer. Please contact Johan Vink if you are interested in participating.<br>

<br></p>
Also in Toronto is another group of FCC parents who started the Riverdale Mandarin Playgroup. Unlike the traditional (aka language heritage) Mandarin schools, the Riverdale group hired a wonderful young Chinese lady who was also a speech pathologist. The fun, play based approach to language training (Mei Mei videos anyone?) has helped establish a playgroup that now has three full classes and a waiting list.<br>
<br>
Both of the above approaches are 100% grassroots creations. Innovative programs developed by parents who saw a need and worked hard to partner with the Chinese community to make it a reality.<br>
<br>
Note: I have a printout of the foils if anyone is interested in learning more about these programs.<br>
<br>
<b>5G - Inside Transracial Adoption</b><br>
This workshop will look at practical strategies inter-country and cross-racial adoptive parents can use to address some of their children's needs. Also addressed will be evaluation and assessment issues for professionals working with families considering transracial adoption. What works and what doesn't for African American, Latino, Asian, and multiracial children in need of adoptive families? Materials have been federally approved for post-MEPA training.<br>
Gail Steinberg & Beth Hall, Pact, An Adoption Alliance, California (<a href="http://www.pactadopt.org">http://www.pactadopt.org</a>)<br>
<br>
Setup for failure - our goal is not to try and bring up our children like they were in a same race home. That is, pretend they are Caucasian or at the other end of the spectrum, think we can bring them up as if they were in a Chinese household. What is important, and what we should be striving for, is to help our children become comfortable with themselves and their cultural identity. <br>
<br>
While support groups like the FCC are good, there has to be more. Our children need full membership in the community that is their birthright. We have to give permission to our kids to explore this. We should push ourselves to go places where we are the only people that are white. What colour are the people you worship with or have dinner with? These are the two most intimate things we do with other people and it greatly influences how our children perceive the world.<br>
<br>
What not to do…<br>
<br>
Several years ago, a group of FCC families in an American city decided that they should purchase several tables and a large restaurant where Chinese families came together to celebrate Chinese New Year. They showed up en masse, with their girls all dressed in brightly coloured silk dresses and sat together at their own tables. Needless to say, the Chinese families at the restaurant were highly offended by this.<br>
<br>
What worked better…<br>
<br>
The following year they tried it again, but this time, Chinese buddy families were arranged ahead of time for FCC families. Instead of sitting all together, the FCC families were intermingled and one-on-one dialogue had a chance to blossom.<br>
<br>
·	90% of social (and other) workers would never dream of transracial adoption<br>
·	Prepare don't protect… need to start talking about colour and racism at 2 and 3<br>
·	Ask your kids a lot: &quot;what do you think I should have said?&quot;<br>
·	Our kids need to de-personalize racism<br>
·	Have to believe our children's antenna if they think something is not right<br>
·	Our families have to be strong (via rituals and other unique things)<br>

<b>6F - Inter-Country Adoption for BC Residents</b><br>
I was going to attend 6D - Adoption and the Schools (notes below), but felt instead that meeting all of the agencies in one place would be beneficial.<br>
The session was facilitated by the AFABC. They have some great workshops coming up:<br>
October 4th, 2003 AM: How Come the Flesh Coloured Bandages Aren't? Understanding White Power and Privilege; PM: Dealing With the Safeway Syndrome: How to Handle Racist Incidents<br>
November 22, 2003 AM: Talk Less/Listen More: How to Listen so Kids can Talk; PM: Racial Identity: Helping Your Child Develop a Positive Racial/Cultural Identity (Module 1)<br>
February 21, 2004 AM: Racial Identity: Helping Your Child Develop a Positive Racial/Cultural Identity (Module 2); PM Celebrating Culture & Heritage<br>
$40 per person or $35 for AFABC members. Call 604-320-7330<br><br>
<b>6D - Adoption and the Schools</b><br>
Adoptive parents often find themselves reinventing the wheel when it comes to adoption sensitivity and the school environment. Find out about a user-friendly yet comprehensive resource that will help you educate teachers, anticipate assignments that may be difficult for adopted or foster children, and advocate for your child in the school setting.<br>
Lansing Wood & Nancy Ng, Families Adopting In Response, California<br>
I picked up the handout, but didn't attend the session. Check out <a href="http://www.fairfamilies.org/newsfromfair/index.htm">http://www.fairfamilies.org/newsfromfair/index.htm</a> for more detailed information (there is a school's section about 2/3rds down the page).<br><br>
<b>7F - Asian Adoptee Gender Issues: Karate Kid vs. the Dragon Lady</b><br>
This session will explore the role of gender in the issues facing Asian adoptees. Race, ethnicity, identity, relationships, stereotypes, and adoption topics such as search and reunion will be discussed and defined from a gender-based framework.<br>
Deborah Johnson, Minnesota Adoption Resource Network o Todd Kwapisz, Holt International Children's Services, Oregon<br>
<br>
Our kids need to learn survival skills from people who look just like them. FCC kids don't come with a label that says: &quot;Chinese with white parents - treat me differently.&quot; When our children move out into the world on their own (school, activities with friends, work), they will experience the stereotypes and racist remarks that all people of colour have to face. <br>
<br>
There will be times (most actually) when they won't feel they can talk to us about it. After all, we have not experienced the barrage of stereotyped messages from the media or had to develop techniques for handling it. Saying, &quot;I understand&quot; to our children rings hollow. Having Chinese friends, teachers, etc. as part of our support team might provide a confidante that our children can turn to when they struggle with these issues.<br>
<br>
Asian Stereotypes:<br>

The following web pages were put up for discussion:<br>

Abandonment is a legal term. i.e. it has to show up on the official documentation we receive, but the term is typically used in a far different context compared to what our children experienced<br>
