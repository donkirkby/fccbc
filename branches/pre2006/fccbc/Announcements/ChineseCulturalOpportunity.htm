<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Nacel Open Door (St. Paul, Minnesota) is
currently expecting over 50 high school students from China, as participants in
the US government-approved exchange program, from August 25, 1999, through June
14, 2000. Students live with a volunteer host family, bring their own spending
money, and are covered by Nacel's organizational insurance policy and support
network. The students attend a local high school, and in the past have been
very well received.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">They would very much like to encourage this
opportunity with other families, as a way for them to share with their adopted
Chinese children, the native Chinese culture.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Interested parties can contact Nacel Open Door,
either by phone (800-622-3553) or email: nacel@nacelopendoor.org, for
additional information.</FONT></P>
