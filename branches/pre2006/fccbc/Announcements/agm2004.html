ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING - 2004<br>
<p>
Please join us for our upcoming annual general meeting on Saturday November 13.  This is a time for us to interact, collectively reflect on/provide input into our priorities and activities, and have some fun.  There will be supervision of and activities for the children (little and bigger ones), a photo slide show, and a wonderful guest presenter.  Many of you have seen Dr. Jan Walls “in action” at our Chinese New Years celebrations a few years ago.  For those who haven’t seen him before, you are in for a treat!
<p>
We’ve shifted venues to Queensborough Community Centre, which many of us are familiar with from the summer picnic. It provides free parking, child-friendly spaces, staff trained in leading children’s programs and an adjacent park if it’s nice weather. 
<p>
We hope to see you there. Please rsvp (number of people and ages of children coming) to me by November 5.
