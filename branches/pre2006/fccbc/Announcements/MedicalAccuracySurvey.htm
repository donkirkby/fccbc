<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Medical Accuracy Survey</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Medical information is needed from families who
have already adopted children from China to assist physicians evaluating this
information to examine its accuracy and predictive value. This informal study
seeks to look at the information provided on the referral from China
(particularly length of the child, weight, and head size), comparing it to the
growth statistics after the child arrives home. When examining referral
information from China, there is very little objective data provided.</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Examining this data (using the Chinese growth
chart) will allow physicians to monitor if this information is useful to
families. If interested, please send your child's date of birth, province, any
measurements shared on the referral (with dates), and any growth measurements
after arrival, particularly at the first doctor visit, with the date of arrival
and date of first visit. Laboratory data, both before and after arrival, will
also be useful. Please also enclose a note that this data may be used for
research purposes. Children will not be identified by name. Information should
be sent to:</FONT></P>
