	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">It's steady as she goes!</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Kimberley has had 3 scans (January, April
		and July 18th) since the "good news" one back in October. All of them show
		virtually no change. While we would certainly prefer better news (more
		shrinkage), at least we can refer to the old adage of "no news is good news".
		Kim continues to take her Chinese herbal drink and of course, we continue to
		pray. We hope you do too. We still have some other alternative treatments up
		our sleeve should it ever come to that. As I alluded to in an earlier column,
		it may very well be that the tumour is dead or may lay dormant for years. I
		have spoken to friends who know people that have been in remission for upwards
		of 30 years. That's what we're counting on. So, for now, we enjoy life to it's
		fullest, with one hand on the throttle and the other ready to grab the
		alternative treatments.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Kim continues to exhibit a great appetite
		and good energy. She attended school all year long and did superbly. She has
		continued on with dance and enrolled in soccer this year. Life is pretty normal
		right now. We actually find ourselves in a position of doing a little planning
		for the summer months .... perhaps a few days of camping on Vancouver Island.
		Once again, we would like to take an opportunity to thank those of you who have
		helped us out over the past 1 &frac12; years (where has the time gone?), either
		with monetary, contributions or thoughts, well-wishes and prayers. It has meant
		a lot to our emotional well-being. We look forward to the day that we can
		invest considerable time and effort into worthy causes to help others who may
		be going through similar troubled times. One way or another, Kim is going to
		make it. I will walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. I look forward to
		the day I have to beat back the boyfriends at the door or check her "I'm late
		because" story with her friends' parents. Each day is a gift and the prospect
		of facing some of life's emotional troubles, is something I'm prepared to
		embrace, because it will mean our big girl has lived many more years. First
		things first though, I must go now to help sort out a toy "ownership" issue
		between Kim and KayLee. In closing, I would like to send along a sentiment of
		warm wishes for you and yours to enjoy a bounty of good health and
		happiness!</FONT> </P>
