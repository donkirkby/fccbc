	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Four years ago, as my husband Eric and I
		were in family planning mode, I also was planning to get involved in some
		community work. This is how it would work: Said husband and I would I complete
		all paper work to adopt our baby from China (one quiet and happy baby -OK, we
		requested twins but never thought...) I would write a proposal for funding to
		the Grizzlies Foundation. I would receive the funding and have one child-free
		year to get the program up and running. We then would travel to China, scoop up
		our baby girl and return home. Sounds perfect, right? </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The likelihood of everything working out as
		I dreamed is, well, as likely as my children standing at attention every time
		the telephone rings! . Instead, Eric and I travelled to China in August, 98
		where we met our twin 14 month old daughters , Olivia Mei-Li and Maggie Qian-Bo
		(did I mention &quot;active and outgoing&quot; daughters?). We were home not more than
		four weeks when the call came: &quot;are you still looking for funding?&quot;. Amidst the
		heaps of happy baby sounds, I muttered (that's how sleep deprived mothers talk)
		&quot;of course I'm still interested.&quot; </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Timing aside, I'm proud to announce that
		all my dreams came true. Our first project, Songs in the Key of Culture, is now
		for sale. Our non-profit society, Project EveryKid Foundation, is dedicated to
		providing after school programs in schools that need them. The EveryKid Choir,
		students from Norquay Elementary in East Vancouver, is 25 of the sweetest
		sounding kids you'll ever hear. ASZA, four multi-talented musicians, created
		the rich and rhythmic accompaniment you will enjoy. Proceeds from the sale of
		the CDs fund future after school programs. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Songs in the Key of Culture is made up of
		14 songs from around the world: Canada, China, Vietnam, Japan, Iran, the
		Philippines, Ireland, and the Puget Sound area. The songs are performed by the
		EveryKid Choir, 25 elementary school students from Vancouver BC. and their
		mentors, seven high school students from Windermere Secondary. The lyrics are
		sung in the language of origin first, followed by English. This is intelligent
		music for children and families. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">ASZA is four musicians from different
		cultures who weave their traditions into an exotic blend of rich and powerful
		music. Using instruments from around the world, they combine the techniques and
		rhythms of many musical cultures. The result is a whirlwind of styles moving
		through a powerful mosaic of sound. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">So gather the family around the CD player
		and get ready to start dancing and singing! This is a collection of music to be
		enjoyed by all ages and cultures. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The cost is $15.00. You can purchase a CD
		through the AFA library or by calling Linda McDaniel at (604) 431-5057 or
