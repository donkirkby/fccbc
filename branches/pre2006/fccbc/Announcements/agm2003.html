                                                The Magician<br>
<br>
<br>
Ray started magic at the age of eleven by working in a magic shop after<br>
school. He worked for the McDonald's Restaurant Corporation for five years<br>
performing eight shows a week for their parties.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to his formative years in the art of magic, Ray took three years<br>
of private ballroom dancing lessons, was a member of Toastmasters<br>
International and studied with some of Canada's top Theatresports<br>
improvisors and comedians.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ray has been dazzling his audiences for the past 18 years with his unique<br>
blend of mysteries from the Orient, baffling effects and hilarious comedy.<br>
He has a gentle way with children, entertaining them at private parties, and<br>
together with his engaging and charismatic personality, Ray is a favourite<br>
at corporate adult functions and family events. His trademark &quot;Orange&quot;<br>
routine is one of the funniest, most amazing effects you will ever see!<br>
<br>
<br>
He is a member of two major magic organizations and is a past President of<br>
Vancouver's oldest magic club, the Vancouver Magic Circle. Ray is a<br>
recipient of the club's &quot;Wilf Rutherford Trophy&quot; awarded for the best<br>
children's magic show, and the &quot;Cecil Ackery Trophy&quot; awarded for the best<br>
comedy magic show.<br>
<br>
<br>
Today, Ray makes his home in Vancouver, Canada, and has performed hundreds<br>
of shows for all occasions.<br>
