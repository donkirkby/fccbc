<h2 align="center">MINUTES OF FCC &amp; NWW EXECUTIVE MEETING - February 2002</h2>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Held February 23, 2002 at 1357 Crestwell Rd.,
West Vancouver</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Present:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">David Robinson Co-chair<br>
Frank Kenny Co-chair<br>
Cathy McDormand Treasurer<br>
Rick Waugh Webmaster|<br>
Kathy Stewart Newsletter Editor<br>
Peter Gibson Membership<br>
Danielle Soulodre Organizer of CNY<br>
Steve Whan Guest<br>
Regrets: Heather McDonald</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The previous Minutes were reviewed &amp;
discussed. Cathy McDormand reported that there was a roughly $400.00 profit from
this year’s New Year’s event, with $120.00 in expenses still to come. Few
feedback forms were completed. Rick to look at putting feedback form on website.
Danielle has kindly agreed to organize next year’s event. She requested FCC
purchase an urn for coffee and will supply an estimate. It was agreed that there
needed to be some discussion about venue and activities but that this should be
postponed until the next meeting. David reported that he had been in touch with
hotels in Richmond with banquet halls as possible future venues. The Richmond
Inn offered good facilities (the hall is free when large numbers attend) but can
only be booked 4 months in advance (CCC have the same booking policy for their
hall). To get a quote for food, we have to provide numbers of adults and
children plus ages of latter; Cathy/Danielle will provide details from this year’s
event, so we can get an estimate from Richmond Inn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also arising from the previous minutes was the
issue of a Culture Camp. John Bowen has reported having had no responses on his
request for feedback on interest and feels he cannot proceed further. David
thought that Wanda might be contacted about her interest in pursuing CCC to see
if they can be persuaded to set something up soon so that our members can be
notified. Danielle will ask Wanda. <i>The summer picnic</i> is to be held on <i>July
7</i> and promises to be a success as in previous years. David &amp; Camille are
to organize a second summer event at Cultas Lake and will put details on the
website and discussion line once they have a date. June or August are the likely
dates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">David spoke on the need to have activities for
older children. There was much discussion of this. Frank has yet to get
information from RVYC about a weekend cruise to Wigwam Inn. However, there was
some concern expressed about age. David thought the ‘older’ children would
include those 6 – 11. Frank thought a cruise might be appropriate only for 8
yr olds and up. Further discussion suggested that 6 – 8 year olds still might
be interested in the New Year’s event if more appropriate activities were
planned for them. This issue needs to be discussed further.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">David suggested that a few times a year, say the
first Sunday of a month, FCC members could drop in at a dimsum restaurant in
China Town, where a back room could be reserved. This would give members and
waiting parents opportunity to meet others. This may also appeal to parents with
older children. This suggestion will be put on the discussion line to see if
members express interest in it. Other suggestions included arranging talks on
adoption issues and arranging a soccer game between older children and adults.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Frank raised the issue of providing services to
waiting families – specifically setting up resource groups for them. There
have been difficulties in locating waiting families via the agencies and in
coordination. Various proposals were entertained &amp; discussed. It was decided
that the best approach would be to hold 3 afternoon or evening teas a year to
which waiting families could be invited by publicity provided through the
agencies/AFABC and our website. Individuals coming to those teas could be then
organized into resource groups if they wished. It was thought that these should
take place in different venues, such as Century House. It was agreed that FCC
would defray the cost of these, since it was fairly low (i.e., $66.00 for
Century House). Frank proposed, and it was agreed, that new member Morgan
Armstrong would be responsible for this service (if acceptable to her) and
should also sit on the executive. She will be invited to the next meeting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Peter reported that membership had risen to 117
families. A new directory of members is now out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">David also stressed the importance of encouraging
members in their localities to organize events such as a picnic and games in a
park, meeting at a restaurant, getting a Chinese teacher for a group of kids.
This was member families in a locality get to know one another and bonds can be
made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was agreed that agencies should be invited to
advertise in the newsletter. Any advert would have to be in the Newsletter for
the year or balance of the year and the cost would have to be paid in advance.
Kathy will send letters to the agencies. Agreed that Family members could
advertise for free but the Editor will retain discretion on what can go in.</font></p>
<i>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next Executive meeting will be April 27</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">
at 3pm at the home of Danielle Soulodre &amp; Steve Whan at 2730 Cresentview
Drive, North Vancouver. 604-987-9852.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The meeting was followed by a very nice pot luck
supper. Frank’s chili was wonderful (spectacular would be a better term),
David mistook the dogs’ food for his but did not appear to notice the
difference (and so the dogs went without supper). Danielle served some delicious
suchi and gave an impromtu lesson on how to make California Rolls. The children
got balloons and a cake with smarties. No money was found in the cake. Missing
in Action: David’s Curry – although we did get a feeble excuse about botched
dates.(or was it because he did not want to blow Frank’s socks off?)</font></p>
