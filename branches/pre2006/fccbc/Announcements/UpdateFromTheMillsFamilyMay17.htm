<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Update from the Mills Family May 17, 2000</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Kimberley's in the ring again!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This time, however, in her corner, is ---
radiation. A recent scan indicates little or no shrinkage of the tumour as a
result of the latest chemotherapy treatment, of which she had two rounds. When
we met with the oncologist at the end of April, he said since the initial scan
(in November/99) there, perhaps, has been a very slight shrinkage of the
tumour. Since the difference is negligible, the doctors feel to continue with
chemotherapy would do more harm than good. (At least the tumour hasn't grown!)
So, the plan is to give radiation a whirl. Kimmy will undergo 16 treatments at
the B.C. Cancer Agency in Vancouver. She underwent her first treatment Monday,
May 15th. Based on 5 days on and 2 off, Kimberley should have her final session
on June 6th or 7th. Perhaps, after her treatment, she can attend the final two
weeks of school. It should also be towards the end of June that we will
determine the results of the radiation treatment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">We've touched somewhat on other options, with
the oncologist, such as traveling to Tijuana, Mexico where some experimental
treatments are available. We also spoke about including Kimberley in human
clinical trials of &quot;metronomic dosing&quot;, the new method that made the
news a month or two ago, whereby small, but constant doses of chemo are given,
in addition to drugs that prevent the growth of blood vessels, which the tumour
needs to feed off of. The oncologist thinks Kim would be a good candidate for
that. There are so many other possibilities, albeit experimental ones. We have
to keep in mind that Kim's tumour is very, very rare and the doctors have
nothing to compare it to. In the meantime, one at a time, one bridge at a time.
Hopefully, the radiation won't make Kimmy too sick.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Her spirits continue to soar and she remains
energetic. She's even gone to school for a few days. The tooth fairy visited
her a couple times lately, too, although one night she forgot, but we think
that more than forgetting, she simply had to go back to bring more money
(because it was a special tooth) and that took time. So, it was the following
night that the tooth fairy arrived with a wheelbarrow-full of money, or so it
seemed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Kimmy doesn't know it yet, but she's going to
the upcoming N Sync concert at Vancouver' s GM Place in June. She loves music
... singing and dancing and nothing makes her happier. So she'll be thrilled
with knowing she's going to the concert. We'll save the news as a surprise
towards the end of her radiation treatment. We'll look forward to giving good
medical news on the next update!! </FONT></P>
