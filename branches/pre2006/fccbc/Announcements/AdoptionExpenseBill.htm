<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Eric Lowther, Reform MP for Calgary Centre, has
brought a private members bill to parliament, seeking to have up to $7,000 of
the expenses parents incur undergoing adoption made tax deductible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Mr. Lowther is asking everyone who supports the
bill to fill in a petition, and return it to him, or to your member of
parliament. We've created an <A HREF="adoption-expense-bill.htm">online version
of the petition</A>, that our members can print off and fill out if they would
like to add their support.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The bill is
<A HREF="http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/1/parlbus/chambus/house/bills/private/C-505/C-505_1/C-505_cover-E.html">available
for reading</A> on Parliament's web site. We would encourage everyone to take a
look at it first, before submitting the petition. It's short and to the
point.</FONT></P>
