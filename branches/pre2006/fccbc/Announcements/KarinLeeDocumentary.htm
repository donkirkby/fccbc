<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The following letter was received from Karin
Lee highlighting her documentary currently in production. ?Ed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">September 2nd, 1999</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>To: Association of Families with Children
from China</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">My name is Karin Lee and I am an independent
filmmaker from Vancouver working with Shan Tam and her company Holiday
Pictures, also an independent producer. We are in the process of making a film
about Canadian families with children from China. We began conducting
interviews with parents and children all across Canada since May of this year.
We have heard many interesting stories from St. Johns', Newfoundland; Montreal,
Quebec; Toronto, Ontario; Regina, Saskatchewan, and Vancouver, B.C.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The documentary will show the unique
experiences of Canadian families with adopted girls from China, ranging in age
from six months to twelve years old. These families will be the nucleus of the
film, and will show us how they raise their children, and how their communities
and peers support the development of their children's cultural identity as
Chinese-Canadians. It will explore the diverse environments of these adopted
girls and the ways in which they develop a sense of identity, cultural roots,
and inter-racial dynamics.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Families from across Canada have generously
agreed to allow us into their lives and to visit their homes. We are currently
still seeking Chinese-Canadian families who have adopted from China. If you are
interested in participating in our research and documentary, please call Karin
Lee at (604) 873-0708 or email me at: <A HREF="mailto:leesistr@unixg.ubc.ca">leesistr@unixg.ubc.ca</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This one hour documentary will be shown on CTV
in August 2,000. We would like to continue filming this fall and next spring.
We are particularly interested in following a family and their child(ren) back
to China for a visit. If you or your family are planning to visit China next
spring, please contact us and we can discuss this trip with you further.</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I hope that we can work together to make this
important documentary a reality. Thank you for your help and
consideration.</FONT></P>
