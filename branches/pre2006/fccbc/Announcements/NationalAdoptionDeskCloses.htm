	 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The National Adoption Desk
		(NAD), a federal institute for over 20 years, is in the process of being
		dismantled. The Desk, a part of the Department of Human Resource Development in
		Ottawa was organized at the request of the provinces (except Quebec) and the
		territories to handle intercountry adoption information, agreements, and files.
		Since that time, the NAD has provided a consistent interface between the
		provinces and other countries. </FONT></P>
	 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Starting August 1, 2000 the
		NAD will begin disengaging from case management. In other words, individual
		family files will no longer be required to go through the NAD. China, in
		response to this phase out will accredit the licensed adoption agencies.
		</FONT></P>
	 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">As of November 1st, the
		licensed adoption agencies will be responsible for sending the China document
		package directly the Chinese authorities (China Centre for Adoption Affairs or
		CCAA). </FONT></P>
	 <P ALIGN="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The NAD's future is
		uncertain at this time. As of March 2001, they will be completely disengaged
		from case management. They will be replaced by the Child, <B>Family and
		Community</B> (CFC) division of Human Resources Development Canada and
		apparently will take on a role of policy development. Further information on
		the CFC can be obtained by visiting their
