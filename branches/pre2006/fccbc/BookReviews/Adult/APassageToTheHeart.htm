<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"><B>Note from John Bowen: </B>I wish this book,
was ready for me to review because although I have not read much more than the
BC articles, I know Amy Klatzlin has assembled a truly wonderful book and I
want every one to try to buy a copy. Think of this book as a Christmas gift not
just because you will be giving someone you know a great present, but you will
also be giving money to orphanages in China at a time when the really need
it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2">Amy just returned from visiting orphanages in
Wuhan, Jingzhou, Yichang (near where they're building the Three Gorges Dam),
Jingmen, Huangshi, and Huanggang China, some of them recently flooded. Listen
to what Director Ke of the Huangshi orphanage said to her. The orphanage was
under about 3 feet of water in August but is now high and dry and all cleaned
up, <I>&quot;When we hear how children are growing up in foreign countries, we
feel very relieved. All of us love this work. We love the children and want to
take good care of them, we want them to grow up to be good people...I want to
express our thanks for your [FCC parents'] generous donations in helping us
with our work. We hope to have further co-operation and more exchange to help
the children.&quot;</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2">Amy went on to describe her trip: &#147;We also
visited the rural county of Jiayu, where the orphanage is still under flood
water and the children have been evacuated to temporary foster families in the
town or to the tent village nearest to the orphanage site I won't soon forget
those dikes in Jiayu. Unless you know the area from before the flooding (and I
certainly don't), you cannot tell from looking which side of the dike is lake
and which side is the Yangzi River. It's one vast brown sea, with trees and
houses and utility poles poking through, dikes lunging out into it for several
kilometers before they disappear into the water, and thousands of people
camping up on the dike tops since Aug. 1 in tents jerry-rigged from bamboo
poles, red-white-and-blue plastic sheeting, and twine. But no signs of disease
or malnutrition where we were; just boredom sprinkled with despair and lots of
stoic resolve&#148; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2">Amy Klatzkin will be touring the United States
in November, promoting the book and is hoping to visit Vancouver. Please let me
know if you would like to meet her and hear more about her recent trip ot
orphanages in China. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"><B>The following is the dust cover description
of the book.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2">An invaluable resource for any family who has
adopted or is planning to adopt from China, A Passage to the Heart gathers
together more than one hundred articles published over the past few years in
the regional newsletters of the leading Chinese-adoption support group,
Families with Children from China, and similar organizations across the United
States, Canada, and Britain. Writing from personal experience as adoptive
parents or professionals working with adoptive families, the authors discuss
such topics as:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> the waiting period; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> the adoption journey; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> settling in as a new or expanded family;
</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> specific issues of health and development for
children adopted from China;; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> the special challenges and rewards of
adopting children over the age of one; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> single parenting through adoption; </FONT> 
</LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> perspectives on China and international
adoption; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> culture, language, identity, and race;
</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> going back to our children's birth country;
</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> thinking about birth parents; </FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2"> and other adoption issues. </FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-2">By turns funny, moving, practical, informative,
and deeply personal, this collection is a treasure trove for all families who
have adopted children from China, as well as anyone who would like to learn
more about international adoption. Proceeds from the book will benefit the
Amity Foundation and the Foundation for Chinese Orphanages--two charitable
organizations providing medical care, foster care, and other services to
improve the lives of children living in China's orphanages.</FONT></P>
