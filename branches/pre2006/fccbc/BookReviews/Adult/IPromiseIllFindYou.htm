	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This book does not, on it's face, have a
		Chinese theme or relate to adoption in any way.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The book is dedicated " with love to all
		the missing children in the world and to the memory of Kelly Cook". A portion
		of the author's proceeds from the sale of the book will benefit child-locating
		agencies.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I knew none of this when I first read the
		book, having borrowed it from the library to read to my daughter.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Immediately the poetry caught me. For me,
		it resurrected a flood of emotion as I recalled how much I wanted my daughter,
		and how I was prepared to search the ends of the earth to find her. I knew she
		was waiting for me, somewhere, and somehow, no matter what the obstacles, I was
		going to find her and bring her home.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">I ended up purchasing the book, more for me
		than for Julia, I think. The rhymes are special to me:</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">"And if I had no other way<BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd walk or crawl or run<BR> I'd search to the ends of the
		earth<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;For you my precious one".<BR> </FONT></P>
