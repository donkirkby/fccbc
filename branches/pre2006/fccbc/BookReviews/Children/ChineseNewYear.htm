<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This small paperback was a &quot;Notable
Children's Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies&quot;. It is an
informative introduction to Chinese New Year customs and traditions, with black
and white photos which compliment the text. The focus is on American cities and
the way in which Chinese New Year is currently celebrated in North America. It
has an objective, school text-book style that does not attempt to tell a
personal story; perhaps for that reason it is not one of my favourites to read
to my child. However, I would recommend it as a worthwhile addition to a
child's library as it gives a good basic background to the meaning of Chinese
New Year customs. Ages 3 years and up. </FONT></P>
