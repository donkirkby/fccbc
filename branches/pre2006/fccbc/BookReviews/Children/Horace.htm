	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This Reading Rainbow book is written for
		the pre-school age child. It deals simply and beautifully with the issue of
		looking different from one's family members.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The story is about Horace, a leopard, who
		was adopted by tigers. Horace has a happy life with his parents and every night
		at bedtime his mother tells him how they chose him when he was a tiny baby. She
		also tells him how they liked his spots and wanted him for their child. But
		Horace always falls asleep before the last part of the story.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">As Horace grows he becomes more aware of
		being different and eventually runs away in search of a family who looks like
		him. He finds some leopard friends and has a wonderful day, but as evening
		falls he longs for home. When his mother and father find him he is very happy
		to return home with them.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">That night Horace finally hears all of his
		mother's story and adds his own special ending.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The story and illustrations in this book
		are simple and charming and the story is heart-warming. I recommend it to any
		of you facing this issue with your child. I had to special order the book from
		my local bookstore.</FONT></P>
