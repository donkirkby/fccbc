<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Written and Illustrated by Ian Wallace, A
&quot;Meadow Mouse&quot; paperback, published by Douglas &amp; McIntyre;
Toronto/Vancouver 1984, reprinted 1995 </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Reviewed by Heather McDonald, FCC BC &amp; NWWA

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This book was the winner of the 1984 IODE Book
Award. The illustrations are the author's own beautiful watercolour artwork.
Looking at the illustrations, I would believe the story takes place in
Vancouver (mountains, seagulls, one picture of what seems to be the East Main
Street skyline), except that the description and illustration of the public
library aren't at a; familiar for either the new or old main library. I wonder
if the author intended on the city to be a fictional Canadian city, with some
of the characteristics of both Vancouver and Toronto. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The story is about a young boy who has always
dreamed of dancing the dragon's dance in the New Year's parade. His grandfather
had taught him the steps, and his dream is about to come true. Chin Chang
suffers a case of pre-performance jitters: will he be able to dance well enough
so that his grandfather will be proud of him and his ancestors will be pleased?
The story progresses with Chin Chiang meeting a new friend who helps him to
succeed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This is a wonderful story about overcoming
one's fears and trying one's best. It is also a contemporary story about
Chinese New Year as it is celebrated in a large Canadian city. The book is
dedicated to &quot;my grandparents for their stories and their songs&quot;; it
is also an intelligent, realistic story about intergenerational relationships
and the bond between grandparent and grandchild. Age group 3 years and up.
