<blockquote>
<p>
Hello everyone.  Since my last message before Christmas regarding  
registration for Chinese New Year I am still getting requests for  
tickets.  I am very sorry to let everyone know that we are at  
capacity and no more registrations are being accepted.  We will  
probably have to investigate other options for a venue based on our  
growing community of families but for this year our event is full.   
Apologies to everyone we are unable to accommodate.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>

<!--<li>2005.06.21 <b>What a picnic it will be!</b><blockquote>
<font face="Arial" 
<p> 
Mark it on your calendars - the annual FCC summer picnic returns to Ryall Park on Sunday, July 3, 2005 from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
</p><p> 
The usual fabulous line-up of entertainment with Fanny Starchild (last year's big hit), bubbles for the little ones, and soccer for the 6 and older gang can be counted on for loads of fun!  Fanny will be on deck from 11:15 am - 1:15 pm and the soccer will get started at 1:00 pm.
</p><p>
This year we have an added surprise - along with drinks for the kids, we are thrilled to announce that we will be providing hot dogs & hamburgers with all the trimmings!  We will do our best to offer a vegetarian choice as well.
</p><p>
Again we are hoping to support a charity in China with proceeds from our Book Sale.  We would really appreciate you bringing some books to sell and plan on buying some "new to you" books to take home.  All books will be $1.00 and exact change would be greatly appreciated.
</p><p>
No pre-registration is required and the cost will be $10.00/family for members and $20.00/family for non-members.  You will be able to renew your membership in the FCC or join as a new member that day and pay the member price of $10.00 along with your FCC membership dues.  
</p><p>
All waiting families are welcome and encouraged to come along.
</p><p> 
So come out and see familiar (and some new and friendly) faces, have lots of fun and support our community at the same time.  
</p><p> 
Feel free to contact Eileen Woo at 604-536-2030 for any information.  See you on July 3rd.

I checked out suitable family motel type places to stay at in Kelowna and these are 3 that seem ok. I have stayed at the Sandlewood Inn a few years back and it was great as it was opposite Gyro beach with its wonderful playground on the beach. 
All 3 motels are near shops and eating places and the centre of town is readily accessible.
So those visiting Kelowna for the Playshops may like to consider the above. Anyone going to the Playshops MUST book a place to stay well in advance as they get fully booked very quickly.
