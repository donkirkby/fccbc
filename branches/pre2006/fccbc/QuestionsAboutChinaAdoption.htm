<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Questions About Adopting in China?</H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">FCC BC  is devoted to providing a
community for families who have adopted children from China. It is a support
organization, a group of people your family can turn to for questions, help,
and someone else who has been through, or is going through, the same issues as
you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">We also like to provide help for those thinking
about adopting from China. However, we are not the best repository of
information on how to adopt, what the rules are, issues and costs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">If you are seriously thinking about adopting in
China, the place to start is the Adoptive Families Association of British
Columbia. <A HREF="http://www.bcadoption.com">Visit their web site</A> for
information about contacting them. They have an extensive library of research
material, both on paper and on video. They have all the latest information on
government regulations, and an idea as to general costs. They run regular
informational seminars on the issues of adopting from a foreign country. They
can also help you compare foreign adoption from various countries, local
adoption, and local special needs adoption.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">However, if you want to talk to someone who has
adopted from China, because you feel strongly that this might be the route for
you, <a HREF="mailto:fcc_bc@yahoo.ca">send us an e-mail</a>. Someone will
contact you shortly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">We do not generally entertain requests for
information or participation in studies, papers, articles, or documentaries. We
have seen a number of these requests come through over the years, and rarely
pass them onto our members. </FONT></P>
